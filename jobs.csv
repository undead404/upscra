You would be provided with the code parts related to existing framework and an example of an existing website scraper using the framework. Your goal would be to implement the scraper for the products of https://flyeralarm.com/uk.

After successfully implementing of the basic product scraper, the second milestone would be implementing a parser to assign the scraped items to the models from our database. After completing that, you'll be given a final milestone, which would the scraping of products and prices based on the given product parameters.

Further information about the specific task and codes we’d deliver you after your first contact. We require a signed nda for this task.

Required skills: Python, Django, Scrapy, Splash, Git, Linux. Knowledge of GitLab and/or German is a plus but not obliged.

For this project I need help with analyzing a dataset of 4000 photos of classical sculptures. The goal here is to generate interesting images that reflect in one way or the other on the dataset or to find interesting new ways of ordering the photos. I’m looking for a freelancer that knows how to deal with image datasets and knows what is currently possible and what not. It is helpful if he / she can think creatively along with me. 

I'm able to do a lot of work myself except coding. So if you write a code, I can implement this myself using the terminal on my mac. Also for deep learning it is possible to use my computer to do all the thinking work. (although for this I need some instructions)

For this assignment there are two things I would like to experiment with. 
1. 80 dollar.
To track the photos with body tracking code to analyse body posture. After this I would like to be able to cluster the images based on body posture.  (so almost that it looks like a dance when seen fast after each other.)  

2. 120 dollar
Use deep learning to generate images, preferably with two different systems to see the difference. For example with or without the use of tensorflow by google. The goal here is to generate images that look interesting and new. Please let me know if I need a larger dataset of images.

Python, SQL and Javascript are a must for this.  You need to understand the basics of unicode.   Experience with Cherrypy is a plus.    

You must not panic at the sight of Asian languages.  Coding is in English, but some labels/text must be in the native language.  Translated text will be provided to you. Pages must be able to display in either of the following languages (English, Japanese, Korean, Chinese).  

You do not need to speak or be fluent in any language except English.

The final implementation does not need to be Python.  We are open to changing platforms. 

We need to query a database and display via web.  The data should update once per minute, only updating information that has changed.  No refresh.  There is one database per site, with 6 sites.   
Pages should have a language select drop down.  Ideally, language and site selection would be possible via the url.
For example:  project.php?site=TOK&language=Japanese

Pages must be able to display on a RaspberryPi 2. 
(edit) This only means that we need to be able to open the page in a browser on a RaspberryPi 2.  An overly fancy or resource intensive page might not load correctly.

We need basic monitoring for this dashboard.  We need an e-mail alert for connectivity issues or if the service crashes.

The final work will include the following pages:

1.)Production dashboard with  some form of wave flow visualization to show the bottlenecks in production.  (Migration + Modification)

2.) Production dashboard to forecast immediate overtime needs.
This is a simple number comparison with a visualization.  Due order VS capacity. The capacity number needs to be something we can set. (edit) Capacity is rarely changes.  Perhaps once a year.

3.)Order entry dashboard. 
(edit) This does not involve writing to the database.  The task is to display information about orders being entered into the system.

4.)Config page that allows for two site theme color setups. Ability to change logo. Ability to set capacity variables to be used.

Handover Notes
=============

Database schema changes are done using EF Data Migrations

scraping.
LeadGenerationController.CreateSession

The user starts a scraping session. A new thread is created to start harvesting leads. Javascript periodically polls for updates on the session (what leads have been generated, progress, status).

LeadGenerator.Process
It makes the google request for each keyword, downloading html

LeadGenerator.GetAds
It parses html using CsQuery to get ad content

LeadGenerator.ProcessResult
Each result is saved in the db against the session

LeadGenerator.HarvestData
For each ad (aka ""result"") it downloads the page content and looks for a phone number using Regex. If it doesnt find one it looks for a contact us page (CSQuery checking links) and checks looks for phone number on that

Autodialling. 
process-wise you can just use the site normally, but once you start autodialling your website gets possessed. It automatically loads a lead and starts ringing them. <presumably at this point you hvae a phone call and make some notes and hang up>. 
Lead.cshtml:100
When you hit the save-lead button, the next lead is loaded and starts dialling straight away. You can turn off auto dialling but it logs you out of the app. It's Brendon's way of applying lots of pressure.
on kmprospect website, when you want to start autodialling, some javascript hits localhost:9999 to tell our windows service to tell the Bria API to tell the software autodialler to start calling the paid version of Bria http://www.counterpath.com

this is our windows service project: KM.Prospect.WinService
it listens to http requests to initiate a phone call, using HttpListener
it sends to softtware dialier via some pretty low level code. This was copy paste from their dev website and I don't understand it.


Dev environment
if you run locally it will create a local db (not sql server)
in linqpad you can connect to it 

1 then maybe you will have to create a user and you can login? 

Not sure prod environment
linqpad can also connect to the prod azure sql database. Need your ip to enable this in firewall Inline 


Deployment
I right click on KM.Prospect.Web in VS Solution Explorer, choose publish, choose
I have just done this to prove it works and also so 100% the code in repo is on prod right now.
It does a VS publish then uploads via ftp. Next time you hit the site it will do EF upgrade.

If we can predict 60% of the time correctly then we can create a basic real time app with a few more feature. The historical data is attached. 

How we define success of prediction: 
Case 1: Lets say the close price of last interval is 300. So normally the open price of future interval is 300 too and lets say our program predicts Low 295, high 310 and close 308. So if the price did not go below 295 and went upto 310 or higher it is a success.

Case 2 :Lets say the close price of last interval is 300. So normally the open price of future interval is 300 too and lets say our program predicts Low 290, high 305 and close 291. So if the price did not go above 305 and went upto 290 or below it is a success too. Because in both cases price went in predicted direction without hitting the stoploss in opposite direction.

I need output something like this

""name"": ""www.salomon.com"",
""email"": [""beynon@veritasinc.com"", ""Angel.Wu@amersports.com"", ""Anne-Sofie.Munk@amersports.com"", ""henna.rauhala@amersports.com"", ""iw@mandel-consulting.com"", ""abe@mandel-consulting.com"", ""katy@spikecommunications.co.uk"", ""claudia_giordani@slalom.it"", ""tomaso.l@spiagames.com"", ""Harunobu.Hagiyama@amersports.com"", ""Fredrik.mandt@amersports.com"", ""press@lymbus.com"", ""elsa@hachepunto.com"", ""swh@mandel-consulting.com"", ""Eliane.Volken@amersports.com""],

""tags"": [""Running shoes"", ""trail running, hiking"", ""ski and snowboard""],
""category"": ""shoes""

for the tags I will give you list of key words and you should detect if the keyword is on the website. If it is there add it to the tags array.

I don't care how you get it. I just hope for 70-80 percent accuracy. If too much information is incorrect (I will test) there will be problems. I'll be ok with 70 percent. I know some info is difficult to get.

-----

Fields 
Email array [] (customer service number is a priority)
Address the headquarters of company
Phone number array [] (customer service number is a priority)
Description : string – usually on home page (possibly get from meta tag)

Images (screen shots) 2 different screen shots for each site (homepage) 
1)	300 width and height 145
2)	The other 100 width and 75 height 
Ex of naming: Yahoo.com-300x145.png
Ex of naming: Yahoo.com-100x75.png


You need 2 folders. Name the folders the pic sizes 

Tags  array[] what keywords are on the site
Category : string in this case it will  be shoes. Actually I will give you  about 3800 URLs of shoes and about 200 socks. 

You must filter out the URL that don’t sell stuff online. I only want ecommerce stores.
If the main topic is “shoes” then you must filter out websites that don’t sell shoes.
If the main topic is “socks” then
Possible ways to detect if ecommerce. I am no expert but I think you can get the html as a string of the link. And this could be applied to all the fields. What I am saying is you can detect the words shopping cart. Or go through the links and see if they have an input for credit cards. You can also check to see if there is a shopping cart logo. I don’t know how you do it just try your best to get it right.

You might need to follow links from the home page to get the contact info. Maybe it is in the “about us” or “contact” page. I would prefer you can detect those links and follow them to get the phone number address and email address. I am aware that some websites don’t provide some info. So then you have to go to whois and find it there (only if info is not on page) and if you get It from whois please mark that you got it from there.

Information about the tags field

The reason why I want that information is to give users a chance to find similar sites. If 2 websites sell beach shoes they are similar sites. And I want to pass this info on to my user. So detect if keywords are on the site and if they are there add them to tags array.

Some keywords for shoes
""boat shoes"", ""boat"", ""maritime"" , ""flip flop"", ""sandal"", ""sneakers"", ""sport"", ""bike"", ""bowling"", ""trainer"", ""skate"" ,""ankle strap"", ""Ballet"", ""Ballerina"", ""clog"", ""beach"", ""biker"", ""Oxford"", ""cleat"", ""climbing"", ""cycling"" ""cowboy boots"", ""espadrilles"", ""rainboot"", ""golf Shoes"", ""loafers"", ""mary jane"", ""moccasin"", ""slingback"", ""slipper"", ""swim"", ""tap shoe"", ""toe shoe"", ""wader"", ""exercise"", ""yoga"", ""gym"" , ""sneaker"", ""medical"", ""diabetes"", ""women"", ""men"", ""luxary"" , ""dress shoe"", ""jelly shoe"", ""lightweight"", ""comfort"", ""running"", ""basketball"", ""slipon"", ""stick-on"", ""stick on"", ""loafer""

Again I will be giving some sock urls the “category” is “socks”. This will be for the 200 or so urls for mostly socks. Make sure that these url sells socks and get the other information listed above

Keywords for socks:
“medical”, “bike”, “diabetes” , “cats”, “fun”, “sport”, “action”, “elegant”, “funny”

Only get websites that *sell* the topic items. I don’t want blogs or news websites.

Other notes
I guess you could add a whois field if you get contact info from whois but this is only for last resort.

Output should be JS object 

I need this done in 5 days.

I've spoken to other people about this and they said they couldn't do it.

The https works now, but url structure is not functioning. when surfing into my domain www.salistore.com for instance it should be salistore.com/en or /sv its now /index.php? The url for products should be /category/productname Now it looks like this for example; https://www.salistore.com/index.php?id_product=33667&controller=product&id_lang=1 

In Prestashop there is a function called ""Friendly URLS"" which lets you fix this, this is what I used before to get the structure of /category/productnam etc.

We are a web development service based in Australia. 
We have regular outsourcing work for web development as we are very busy. 
Our clients range from professions to selling products online. 
We provide our clients a quality, professional product at a fair price. We work on trust, honesty and intelligence. 



Who are we looking for?

We are looking for a long-term team who can assist with on-going projects. 
We want a trusted team -  ideally a small team with a diverse skill sets. From graphic design to web development. 



So, if we like long-term, why are we looking now? 

Unfortunately, the reason we are now looking for a long-term partner is because our existing web team (who we have worked with for 7 years) has now delivered inconsistent work in the last few weeks. Sadly, we are now forced to look for another team. 


Tools we use: 
We use Basecamp to manage our briefs & keep track of project status.
We also use Skype to be easily contactable for messages & calls. 



What do we need from you?

English - reads & understands briefs clearly. No spelling mistakes in the website.

Quality - Checks work before sending to us. Retains quality. 

Proactive - Sees a problem, format flaw and fixes it or gives us options on what solutions we can have, before we see the problem. We require regular & proactive updates and consistent quality. 

Talented - your designs are inspiring because you love design. You will give us options and advice if you think something looks better. You won't just agree with us every step. You have a brain and we want you to use it. Sure, we may not agree later, and the client may have final say, but you are part of the design team and you are not a robot. 

Attentive - You pay attention to the details in the brief and make sure what the client wants is done properly. To show you have read this, please state in your first line of application what shape in the moon. The business needs of the client are just as important as the design.

Honest -  not afraid to tell us what is happening - good or bad. 


How do we like to work? 

Collaborative Honesty - As with any business, trust is key. We want to work long-term with you, and we need to build trust. So what does this mean in real life? 

This means: You will be open with us with our project needs. You will not just say ""yes yes yes yes"" to keep us happy, and then let us down later. You tell us how your team is doing - whether they are overworked, or is there room for  2 more projects, or do we need outside expert on software for this project? You must be upfront with these things.

We understand that there is pressure to keep a client happy, but we don't want this attitude of ""say anything to keep them working with us"". This is not the way we want you to work with us. 

If you give us great work, are professional and up-front, we will commit to working with you long-term.

At link2light we are well known for our SEO and Online Marketing work. In fact we are a little too well known with a substantial waiting list of clients for services in these fields.

As a result we regularly contract out general work and this is one such project.

This project is primarily about programming in new features to an existing website using php, MySqli, AJAX, etc. probably using BootStrap UI so design skills are not required.

Key changes are:
 - an administration area to manage orders
 - a customer login area 
 - improved storage of data related to orders

To whom it may concerns,

	Soieries du Mékong (SdM) is a social business which is working on improving women’s empowerment in rural areas in Cambodia by providing to youngers a silk weaving training, a sustainable job, and by promoting their traditional know how. 


	We would like to work with you on the User Interface / User eXperience to improve the profits of SdM’s website by increasing its conversion rate:

Please refer to the following google spreadsheet which is listing every task of the project and its details (to identify your tasks, have a look at the “IT support” mention in the “assigned to” and “monitored by” columns):
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c561vfhIxbBntvTcpQi4GsGBCf-398KRKeUuFPX5LJo/edit?usp=sharing


You would firstly be involved in the task described below. We would like you to estimate its cost, as well as the amount of time you would probably need to accomplish it.

DUPLICATE SDM’S WEBSITE TO CREATE A STAGING SITE (task #33 in the project sheet)

Our advances:
        We already created a hosting place on our own servers and did the settings of the subdomain.
We also created a designed empty file on the server using the FTP (tree structure will be communicated in due course).
We finally updated the destination files for the existing ftp logins.
The staging site is already available online at the following address: http://test.soieriesdumekong.com

Your mission:
	The files you will have to duplicate to create the staging site are quite heavy. We do not have enough place on the server for now. We will have to work together on SdM’s database to free some place by deleting useless tables/folders. 
	After having created enough place on the server, you will have to clone the website on the designed location. It is very important to isolate the staging site’s database from the live site’s one while proceeding this step. The final result should be an exact copy of the existing website: http://soieriesdumekong.com/
	Finally, you will be asked to create FTP logins so that nobody except the ones that have the credentials can access it.

	We estimated the cost of this task to be around 112$. This amount is the result of the average hourly wage of a qualified IT engineer (28$, sources : payscale, blog) multiplied by the estimated number of working hours (4). We eventually are up to any more competitive offers.

	We would like the task to be done by the middle of next week at least.

Once we find an agreement, we would provide you with our FTP IDs (server, login, password), our PhpMyAdmin IDs (URL, login, password) and our prestashop backend IDs (URL, login, password).
You would also be pleased to comment your tasks on the provided spreadsheet so that we can update their status.


In order to achieve this mission, we will need the help of a qualified and trustable web engineer. Freelancers with experiences in our digital environment (CMS: Prestashop, Host: OVH, MySQL admin tool: PhPmyAdmin) would be valued.

As you probably noticed by looking at the provided spreadsheet, our digital project is quite ambitious and we would most likely need further IT supports to complete it. If we are both satisfied by our potential partnership, we would be happy to maintain it for further missions.

(Please note for this new website, we do not want open sources like woo commerce or zen cart so please do not offer me open source solutions.)

We want to copy all of our products from existing website and add some new products to the new online shop. This new website 

must be 1) mobile friendly responsive design
 
must have 2) options of ""sizes"" and ""colors"" on end-user interface.
As for admin user interface, if some ""size"" and some ""color"" of the product
become out-of-stock, we should be able to easily ""disable""
this ""size""-""color"" option on the product, and of course keep the product
active and able to sell other sizes and colors. 

3) Should have price table so that we can setup different prices for 1pc of the product A and 12 pieces of product A.


Examples of product page interface we want to have are:

https://www.suddora.com/products/multiple-color-plain-head-sweatbands

https://www.eroswholesale.com/closeouts/socks/knee-high-socks-12672.htm

http://www.kavio.com/youth-sheer-jersey-contrast-raglan-3-4-sleeve.html

4) keywords-friendly URLs

5)  visitors can view the review stars visibly on each product page like at suddora.com and kavio.com examples. If these review stars are linked with/extracted from *Google review stars* that would be better.

6)All of the color option pictures should be visible on the product page
so that customers are able to view all the colors *without"" clicking the color option button.


We will provide Products descriptions and images (from existing website and some new images), and I need your team to set up/upload products names, new/additional descriptions, images, options, option images, etc for us. We have a new domain name already, and I will make a shopify or bigcommerce account to give to you. It's better your description editor can write nice & unique descriptions that include keywords.

Please send me your offer which includes price and estimated time based on my requirements above. Please include your past projects websites URLs for our review.

I currently have a developer and a copywriter, so I will mainly need you to provide/tweak fashion images, font, colors, aid in enhancing the landing page, essentially helping me create a fashion store that rivals my competition and converts.

The designer must also posses knowledge of psychological coloration's that customers prefer when it comes to shopping for clothing. ( I want the customer to feel sophisticated and comfortable when shopping). 

It is highly recommended that the candidate has knowledge of fashion, or at least fashion eCommerce stores, as this is what the whole project is centered around.

The website is a combination of wordpress and woocomerce, with ""Avada"" as a theme.
Since a project like this is mostly creative, I would like to go page by page with you brainstorming ideas. We can utilize google docs, in which my developer will take the changes we decide on and implement them. 

I placed a valuation on what I believed to be fair; however, If you feel extra efforts are required, I am open to renegotiating terms.

If chosen, you will work alongside the developer and I to accomplish the task of creating a unique and persuasive UI/UX for the customer.";Graphic Design;Help needed in FASHION webdesign.;http://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01a22579697dbc5d02;;4;0

1) The website itself. (Currently using wordpress with woocommerce)
2) The basic UI that will be used for customer to upload their images and get a basic rendering of what it would look like
3) After customer completes order and checks out, a way to take the images they uploaded and convert them into a printable PDF according to a very specific template layout. Customer never sees this PDF, it is for sending to printers. Maybe this PDF can be generated upon order within backend through code....or maybe images will have to be bulk exported and then imported into Adobe Indesign (which is what we are doing now). If this is the solution then will need macro built for indesign that takes the images and places them in the indesign template.

Someone with iOS and Android mobile app development is also a plus, but for this first phase not needed.

We are building a system for owners of horses to add their horse information and then connect with other users of the system (4 different user roles in total). Users need to be able to click on a link in the system to initiate a chat session with one user (they should then be able to add other users to the chat, but just start with one). The chat session should be stored such that the user can look up the chat history at a later date. They should also be able to tap a button (similar to Apple Messenger or Facebook Messenger) to upload a photo (or take a photo if on a mobile phone) which will share with the other user(s) on the chat as well as store the photo to the record for the horse.

We are building the application on PyroCMS 3.x which is based on an un-modified Laravel platform. The application is not using it as a CMS in the traditional sense with pages and posts like wordpress. All content is run through custom modules.

For this job, we need someone to build a composer vendor package (or, ideally, a PyroCMS module) that would wrap the OpenTok platform and allow us to use a facade or simple helper type call that will launch a chat in a new tab between the initiator and the invitee. I need minimal integration, having it use the built-in Laravel user auth info for the users. The styling of the chat css needs to be accessible (or publishable) so we can modify it to our needs. As a starting point, we like the Sendbird live chat sample layout  (https://sample.sendbird.com/livechat/) so something like that would be great except without the need to login.

IMPORTANT - If you are able to just use the javascript files supplied to make this work and can style them as per the supplied webpage then the shortcode route can be scrapped.

RE: WEB DESIGNER NEEDED
      To Send an Auto Response Upon Receiving PayPal Payment

I DON'T LIKE MY PAYPAL BUTTON NOW
I have a website with paypal shopping cart “Buy Now Button.” I am selling some digital books (both dBooks and eBooks). A dBook is digital book that can be read on a webpage. An eBook is a PDF file. For example, the price of the dBook or eBook could vary from $4.99 to $9.99. Each dBook has webpage with URL, and each dBook is password-protected. That means the buyer has to enter username and password to read any dBook on my webpage.

Right now, when a buyer buys the dBook from my website by clicking on “Buy Now Button,” I receive an email from paypal confirming that the payment ($9.99) has been received successfully. After I received that email, I send an email to the buyer, including the URL of the webpage, username and password. This is a very slow process and it would be frustrating to the buyer because the buyer has to wait some 24 hours or even more time to receive the URL of my webpage, username and password.

THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO
I want to speed up this process by linking an AUTORESPONDER to the paypal shopping cart so that the buyer would instantly receive the URL of my webpage (dBook), username and password immediately after the purchase. So I am looking for a web designer who could do this job.

THIS IS WHAT A WEB DESIGNER SHOULD DO
a. The web designer should have a papal account. The web designer should create a sample dBook or eBook with only a few pages with anything on it and should sell it for $1 or $2 on his/her website. The web designer should install a paypal button (Buy Now Button) on his/her website with appropriate code by linking the paypal shopping cart to an autoresponder (for example integrate paypal button with Aweber) so that the buyer would instantly receive the URL of the webpage (dBook or eBook), username and password. When the integratd paypal button is ready, the web designer should let me know that I could visit his website and test the paypal button.

b. I will then go to the web designer’s site, and buy the dBook or eBook for $1 or $2 by clicking on paypal’s Buy Now button. I will pay $1 or $2 with my credit card. Then, I should be able to instantly receive the URL of the webpage (dBook), username and password. Then I will try to open the dBook or eBook using the URL, username and password provided by the web designer. If it is all working correctly, that means the web designer completed the coding of the paypal button correctly. 

c. The web designer can then sell his/her code to me, and help me install the same kind of integrated paypal button on my website for an asking price. The web designer should help me by talking to me over the phone. I will negotiate with the price.

c. If it is all working fine, then I will extend a payment to the web designer. The web designer should be honest and should let me know how many hours he/she worked on this job, and how much money he wants. 

WHERE AM I?
a. I live in Vancouver area, British Columbia, Canada.  I have a Linux C-Panel hosting account with Godaddy.com. I also have a paypal account.  I use two email addresses to receive payment confirmation from paypal such as hotmail.com email address or shaw.ca email address. The web designer can access my email account and capture the buyer’s email address, if needed, upon paypal payment confirmation. 
b. I have a desktop computer at home with Windows-7 recently re-installed with browsers Firefox, Google Chrome and Internet Explorer. I never installed and used Skype before. If skype is needed, the web designer has to teach me first how to install and use the skype program.

HOW MUCH CAN I PAY FOR THIS JOB?
The web designer can make an offer for a fixed contract to do the whole job or for an hourly pay. I would choose the cheapest offer of any web designer. I prefer to pay $5/hour. I will check everything and test the code thoroughly and will make sure that everything is working perfectly (100% correctly) before I extend any payment to the web designer.

We would like to integrate some information http://coinmarketcap.com/ which has all the Crypto currency’s listed, we would also like to have the same information as this link, like charts , search for coins, a list of coins , a list of exchanges that trade coins ect, the only add on would be the function of a forum to so people can talk about these coins. We would also like to have the API's from these exchanges plugged in so that we can have live prices showing 

The design layout or colour  scheme should like www.hotmail.com or like this link http://phpbb3.pixelgoose.com/preview-metro/?theme=Blue%20Metro, I really love the flat layout & icons from with minimal colour schemes 

The website should be able to load very fast & look good on any/all devices, browsers ect

We would also like to have an easy to use backend where we can view profiles , get alert on certain words being used on the site, allow workers to have access to moderate posts, suspend profiles , cancel profiles , have a monitor that tells us if IP address is being used more then once ect   
 
I would like for you to spend so time looking at these links & tell me how much you would charge for doing this.

1. As in picture, create into  html page the following page:, user chooses, from country, destination country from drop down list.. then enter kg of parcel.. 
1kg = 50usd, so the would be an automatical auto-increment in database of 50usd in price for each increase in kg,  That is basically 1-kg  is 50usd, when 2kg is entered it increases to display a price of 100usd etc

eg. 1kg =  50usd
2 =  100usd
3 =  150usd etc

On click user get an estimate price based on selected kg ... the would be a button asking user to contunue (click here to continue) 
upon click to continue, a form then presents and ask of first name, last name, email, destination country, delivery adresse, phone number,  (that is user details)

After user enters this details he be redirect to a loading page for 10secs and then he gets finale page where, he gets summary of every thing

Full name, destination country and once again the previous estimate price of shipment..i would provide the html page to work on and cpanel..regards

More details:
I'll be speaking to a large crowd of approximately 1500 people (N). The day before I speak, I'll be able to access the theatre I'll be speaking in, and will know based on seating arrangements what size of groups I can make (x) and precisely how many people are attending the day I'm speaking (N). 

On the day of my presentation, I'll split the audience into groups of size x (so, N/x groups total).

I'll make a quick demonstration of the ""birthday problem"" (look it up on Wikipedia if you aren't familiar with it) to show them how human intuition is not great for probability, but instead of groups of 23 that have slightly over 50% probability, the group size (x) may be more like 50, which has a higher confidence percentage (97%).

I'd like you to create a python script that I can run at the last minute to know with 90% confidence what the following results are. I can enter the variables at the start to execute what I need to see the results (I'll be using Jupyter - and please presume I don't have any packages pre-loaded and add it to the code)
1. Probability of two people sharing the same birthday for the group size x is. (This should 
use 1 - this calculation: https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1eebef59be4c39d8d31e802c9aab03dc485f69a5 )
2. Probability of three people sharing the same birthday for the group size x (this should use the equation given after ""P (at least one triple birthday with 30 people)"" on this page: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/25876/probability-of-3-people-in-a-room-of-30-having-the-same-birthday with '30' replaced by our x)
3. This final one will require your own probability Mathematics skills to come up with a useful equation. I already started a discussion on this topic on the Maths stackexchange here: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2332412/interactive-problem-to-demonstrate-non-intuitive-probability-results-to-a-large (crowd size has changed, but otherwise you may find the answers helpful).

What I'd like is a 90% confidence of the final expected number (and +- range within this confidence level) of *individuals* of our entire audience size N, when split into non-interacting groups of size x, who share a birthday with one or more people in their group of x people. Since the groups are not interacting, I imagine this is the expected number of birthday matches for one single group times N/x, but my probability is too rusty to be sure, or to come up with the equations and the complex implementations in python to make this work.

This way I can be pretty sure of the number of people who will have raised their hands. I'll have helpers who will do the counting for me, and I can compare the actual result with the predicted one.

If you are up for the challenge let me know! The fee covers everything discussed here, and any related follow-up questions. If additional requests are made, I would add bonuses. You can ask me whatever you like to know limitations etc. The final output to send to me is simply the text I'd use in Python for me to open in Jupyter. If this goes well, I may consider you for similar requests in future.

When you reply the very first word of your message should be pandas - this way I'll know you actually read this. Otherwise I will reject your application immediately. Deliverability within one week.

Blue Cotton has a great example of this. We would like a Live Chat section and perhaps some way of capturing and displaying online review and comments from Facebook. We currently do not have a landing page for capturing e-mails or offering specials. We have no mechanism for sending art proofs out or the ability for a customer to retrieve a design they saved or if they were to place an order the ability to track it. OOshirts.com has this feature. There are other features we like to discuss the viability of adding to the site. A good example would be videos. I especially like the look and flow of www.threadbird.com. It looks very sharp to me.

I need a clone of this site:
http://top5-hostingsites.com/

Same design ( with minor changes I have an image of what I want to see )and all (ALL) content 
in terms of Admin in Wordpress I will need this special ability:
1) define the table order for each page (that has a ranking table) :
I need to be able to control each brand text , and data of each column for each page that has a table ( for instance look at 
http://top5-hostingsites.com/
and
http://top5-hostingsites.com/domain-hosting/
they look the same but the table is different for each.
2) be able to control the link of associate with each item in the table for each page
3) be able to define filters (you can see them at the top) and for each filter to define the the result sets of the brands to show
4) for each Table in each page to have these toggles and options in the admin :
Show stars Yes/No
Show price Column Yes/No
Choose button color
Shot grade Yes/No
Show Special Border on first item in the table Yes/No --> if yes - then be able to choose first item border color
5) be able to control all text on site from admin ( goes without saying in WP but still make it clear) 
6) be able to control the Advertiser Disclosure text) 
7) to be able to control all menus ( again basic in WP) 
8) the site should be optimized to google page speed - meaning that after cloning and adding all features and content you are copying (including images) - site page speed in google page speed tool should be of score of at least 95 on Desktop and at least 95 at mobile ( this is extremely important) 
9) light mobile version should be as well like reference

In many ways a classic RoR CRUD business application: a database of specialized PR and marketing opportunities.  Mostly prefer classic Rails ERB CRUD views & controllers,  except where necessary for performance or UI reasons we use React.js (via React-rails gem) to render UI and interact with an api via Javascript.  

The Rails application uses a somewhat exotic ""Component Based Rails Architecture"" CRUD approach (see: http://cbra.info/) so, more experienced Ruby developers necessary.

App is styled using the Bootstrap 4 CSS framework.

I'm the main developer, there is one other UpWorker helping.  The app has about ~20 models and 20k LOC.  The codebase is in good shape.  

We need to accelerate development, and are looking to get another senior developer involved.

We are looking for a more senior developer, someone who can communicate with the business team and understand the software from a high level.

To start, you'll collaborate with me on Github, developing features, doing tasks, etc, and I will handle reviewing, merging, and deploying the app to Heroku.  However, as trust builds, this senior developer could grow to manage the production instance as well.

Please make sure you understand what needs to be done. If you have any questions before taking on the job, we will be more than happy to answer.

We have some code that is pulling in a reviews feed widget to one of our sites (it pulls from Google, Facebook, UCompare, ZocDoc, and any 1st party data that's 4 or more stars), which you can see in action here: https://snhbirthplace.org/widget-test/ , the first element on the page. 

But the client would like the reviews to be pulled into some sort of rotating format, I think it would be great if they could populate the testimonials similarly to the carousel testimonials section right below the widget (these are static content at the moment, just as an example). 

If something like this is too complicated, the client originally cited the following page as to how the reviews can be pulled in, look under ""Testimonials"" - http://www.snhhealth.org/our-locations/practice-locations/specialty-care/nashua-center-for-healthy-adults . You can likely reference the feed on this page to see how the reviews are pulled in. They'd like to display one review at a time, preferably showing the star rating, review content and link to where the review was originally placed - along with controls to view the next or previous review.

The widget code we have currently is attached. You may also need the location key for the feed, which is 201. 

Some notes from our previous developers:
They are saying a custom wordpress page template (or plugin) would have to be created to accomplish. Their goal was to go about this with the following steps (these are just guidelines, if you know another way to accomplish the task, we are open to suggestions):

1. get DOM data from https://widgets.reputation.com/widgets/594c0ef8fd02425a5f722374/run?tk=9be41d11aa5

I’d like to have my Shopify e-commerce store ready for launch for Labor Day weekend, preferably August 31st.

I’ve already built a functioning framework. I developed it to see if Shopify was the right platform for us. The designs and copy currently on the site are all placeholders, it’s a mock up.

I’ve purchased a third-party Shopify Theme through Envato Market and customized the theme using Shogun Page Builder to design the different pages including the homepage. In essence, I’m only using the theme for its navigation bar, footer, its product page (which I’d like to customize), and all its foundational coding that makes it a working e-commerce site.

If the framework I’ve built is good to move forward with I would utilize you for intensive, time consuming coding and to check over my own coding/designs.

Most of this job of converting the existing site to a woocommerce site and changing the template CSS for the look and layout to our new files has been done. However, the previous developer did not finish the job. We now need a few small adjustments done and pages copied over as well as the checkout setup to work properly with our Braintree merchant account. Code can be picked from our existing site, but needs to be cleaner than the existing site as a a unified language. 

- currently built on Woocommerce free theme - https://woocommerce.com/storefront/?utm_source=notice&utm_medium=product&utm_content=storefront&utm_campaign=woocommerceplugin
- We have PSD and .AI files for the layout and checkout pages and popups. Most is done, but we will supplky you with everything as we still need a few touch-ups. 
- use our existing paid plugins for woocommerce for functionality to allow subscription payments and pre-orders. 
- copy some items directly from our existing site backend (we have custom order confirm / shipping confirm / password reset emails that we wish to keep)
- copy code to migrate our ""Team"" page with team member bio's
- We require all functionality for uploading new products for regular products, subscription, as well as pre-sale (as invoice so we can capture payment and shipping info and allow us to only charge the customers credit card upon a specific date once we have enough pre-orders)
- add Affiliate marketing tracker (so i can have people share my products with a unique tracking link and pay them a portion of the sales they generate). I believe this is easy enough with Yith themes for free or a plugin. I am not sure the best method. But this is very important to have for our new site. 
- Remove the PVP section from the new site as we will no longer be allowing uploading and voting on artwork. The homePage PVP section should simply be changed to ""Coming Soon"" 

Optional items:
- Arcade (currently the arcade section is broken and will not allow games to play. So we can leave this out as well, if it will be to extensive to fix the issue.

  ~~ time it will take you to build the site - hopefully one week or less
  ~~ how much it will cost --- flat price -- not pay by the hour as listed below

It will be similar to a website called letgo.com or craigslist. This is a web app for ONLY college students to use. This site will have a way for students to create profiles, post products/services, communicate through a messaging feature, etc as explained with Kirill Y. Each school will have its own marketplace that cannot be accessed by other schools. For ex. Quinnipiac students can only interact and see products/services posted by other Quinnipiac students. You can only access this platforms if you have a .edu email address and confirm from the email provided.

In order to post anything they would need to have an account. Also please note that the only way someone can have an account is if they have a .edu email. They are not able to access this platform unless they are a student.For example the student would need a name@quinnipiac.edu email in order to create an account. It is very important that each school has access to ONLY their own marketplace.Quinnipiac students with ONLY quinnipiac students. Upon students ONLY with Uconn students. Once a user wants to create an account they would need to go to their name@Quinnipiac.edu email and verify their account. Once we have proof of concept we will open up the platform for other students to use. We would also need a way for other students to contact us to let us know that they want this app to come to their school. Contact us page is required. A payment feature will also be required later on once we open up to different schools. An about us description is required in which we will provide information. Also needs to be included; terms of service and privacy policy descriptions will be provided. Twitter as well as Facebook page will need to be connected.

 This needs to look very professional, as well as work within projected price provided. The UI/UX needs to be incredible and easy to use and maneuver through the site. There will also need to be some way to track what is going on in the web app. IT is very important to have a type of dashboard that only i can use in order for me to keep track of all of the information and and product/services that are getting posted, seeing how many users are currently on the platform, etc.  Once complete i will need all of the coding and development work that has been done to create the website. Also would need to stick with the projected timeframe of 1 month to get this project up and running. Further details have been provided to Krill. Please let me know if their are any further questions that i can help with.

Example: something like how this page is set-up - http://www.cheapcarinsurance.net/florida-car-insurance.html

what I am trying to do is have a search box specific to each CITY/MARKET/

We have a small company (15 employees), and we are moving out of an antiquated commerce platform to Shopify. We have quite a few marketing components in place on our old system that we need to duplicate and/or replace using Shopify and the apps available for that platform.

Our old system is coupled with a 3rd party system called ""Barilliance"" (company is based in India), which has allowed us to do some fairly sophisticated things with our pop-up offers, abandoned cart emails, discount codes, etc.

We are looking for someone who understands the complexities of moving from a system like Barilliance and getting everything set up correctly in Shopify, and someone who is proficient enough to help us going forward with things like app installation, overseeing the general workings of our cart, resolving issues with our shopify theme, etc. We hope to do a ""test launch"" of our new store in a few weeks and really need someone who can jump in right away.

We currently have the following apps integrated with Shopify, some in various stages of completion:
-Klaviyo
-Privy
-Instant Search+
-Recommendify
-Shogun Page Editor
-Rewind Backup for Shopify
-Sticky ""Add To Cart"" Bar® + Sticky Cart

-need to do further integrations involve in some of the above apps, as well as find some ""missing"" apps; for example, we have yet to find something that will enable us to do a simple post-purchase feedback form (we want actual text fields, not just radio buttons) off the thank you page (as opposed to coming in via email).

I made a video to explain what I need for this job:

https://www.useloom.com/share/df7d31e33f394ec0a4c78b7dc92cd659

Some points: 

1. Main job is to add that top section that shows the headline, sub headline, button and gorilla background

2. The top section should be HIGHLY mobile responsive. The background image should be different for desktop Vs. tablet and mobile, because I want the gorilla's face to appear only on the left of the screen on desktop, but on tablet / mobile, the gorilla's face can be full width. I will send you the images for these when I give you this job.

3. When someone clicks the orange button 'browse courses' the page should scroll down to show the course filter drop down menus at the top of the screen

4. The drop down menus section needs to be made much smaller, shorter, compact, so it doesn't take up the whole screen, especially on mobile. I think this is just basic CSS, changing the vertical space / gaps between the drop down fields and the text.

5. You will need to duplicate the existing page that is set as the homepage and edit the duplicated version. The reason why is that I need the current version of the page to remain the same for when people click on 'courses' in the top menu. 

6. The theme is built using Enfold child theme, highly customized. If you are familiar with the Enfold theme already, this is a huge plus, so let me know if you are! 

7. I like people who read all of my job descriptions properly, so please reply with the word ""Gorilla"" as the first line of your reply. 

8. I really, really like developers who pay attention to the small details to make the site look really clean and professional. I don't like it when a developer works on a job and it looks messy / rushed / clumsy. Spacing between elements, and getting key things above the fold to maximize conversion rates are things that I care greatly about.

UI
 - The UI would be using fancytree (https://github.com/mar10/fancytree) with the ability to move AND order nodes via DND between parents/siblings/children, that's why I was thinking of using a little NoSQL pattern with childrenids.
 - I like the jstree filebrowser demo, https://www.jstree.com/demo/, where the root will be the bookmark list entry.
   - Left Click on node -> Show details right side and DND.
   - Right Click: New Bookmark and New Folder menu options.
OR the inline editing in fancytree.

API endpoint 
 - No authentication neede and exports the trees active nodes (in json) from a passed in urlid, just title and url.
 - This endpoint will be hit a lot.

Notes:

 - LAMP, mysql with PDO, jquery and bootstrap.
 - Id's are uniquely generated 16 char strings.

If url == null and parenturlid == null then this is a bookmarks list node, see screenshot, this will be the root for each tree.
if url == null and parenturlid != null then this is a folder node.
If url != null and parenturlid != null then this is a bookmark node.

Proposed single table layout, this app will probably be moving to Mongo later on, so I'm open to suggestions. That being said, I would like to not use any Stored Procedures, etc.

Range Sliders and Form Building (Javascript, JQuery, HTML) For Cleaning Services Website

Project Overview:
1. Challenges I need solved:
I need a homepage widget with two range sliders with fixed steps.  As the handle moves down the range slider via mouse or arrow keys, I need a label on the left side of the range sliders to indicate the value demonstrated by the handle, i.e 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  One range slider changes the number of bathrooms and the other changes the number of bedrooms.

Furthermore, I will have a listed price in the same homepage widget that changes depending on the values selected by the range sliders.  The affected listed price visual will appear on a ""schedule your appointment"" button.  For example, it will appear as ""SCHEDULE YOUR APPOINTMENT $101/clean"", with the dollar amount changing based on the selected values.  Below the two range sliders are 4 buttons.  Each button is a different option that discounts the listed price in varying amounts, so i need 2 range sliders and 4 buttons that work together and change the listed price in whatever sequence the buttons or range sliders were activated. 

Lastly, I need my website visitors' final, selected widget information, i.e info and pricing collected from the buttons and range sliders, to be mirrored on another page (the booking page), where I have installed a booking software called Launch 27.  I have the API for Launch 27.  I need the selected data/values on the formerly mentioned homepage widget to show up when the ""SCHEDULE YOUR APPOINTMENT (with price)"" button is selected.  In other words, the data/values need to be saved and transferred from the homepage widget to Launch 27's booking form.  

Here is an exact example of the homepage widget I'm looking for, https://www.maidsinblack.com/ .  And, here is an example of how the values are saved and transferred onto the booking form, https://www.maidsinblack.com/book-now/.  

2.  Tying into my business goals:
The purpose of this widget and page-to-page automation is to conveniently facilitate the booking process with Kempt, my local maid/cleaning service.  I want to make the booking process online and super easy for customers.
  
Project Description:
1. What will be the freelancer’s responsibilities?
a.)  Code a widget for my homepage that contains: 2 range sliders with fixed steps and labels on the left hand side listing the value selected, they also must change the listed price below; below the range sliders I need 4 horizontal buttons that change color on click, and change the listed price below based on the type of discount/button that was selected; and lastly, below the range sliders and 4 buttons, I need a large rectangular button that reads ""SCHEDULE YOUR APPOINTMENT (*listed price)/clean"".  

b.)  Program my website in such a way that the settings selected on my homepage widget will be saved and transferred to my booking page, which is formatted with Launch 27, an online booking software.  I have the API for Launch 27.  

2. What qualifications am I looking for?
As my expertise is limited to design, I am not 100% sure what coding languages are necessary for the job, but it seems like Javascript and JQuery would be sufficient.  If another language offers a better solution, then please let me know.  Of course CSS and HTML will be necessary for the job as well.  I am looking for experienced, intermediate to advanced developers.      

Skills:
1. What are specific skills needed for the project?
Javascript, JQuery, HTML, CSS, and other languages you find useful.

Logistics:
1. What is the project deadline?
An ideal deadline would be less than a week.  As long as quality is not compromised, the sooner it's finished the better.  
2. I would like to hear various offers in terms of what you think is a fair price for the energy and expertise necessary for this job.  Please let me know whether you'd prefer an hourly or fixed rate.  I know with smaller jobs a fixed rate might be more fair for a developer.  If I am satisfied with your work, there will likely be future jobs for you as well.   
4. In addition to pricing suggestions, please answer these two questions if you're interested in the job:
Question 1 -- Have you done a similar job before? If so, what was it, may I please have a link?  If not, why are you still a good candidate for the job?
Question 2 -- How confident are you that the job can be easily completed?  Explain your answer please.  
 
5. About my business:
Kempt is a local cleaning/maid service that offers a super convenient online platform for instantaneous booking.  Kempt is where low-tech services meet high-tech support and convenience.   

Thanks for taking the time to look into this job.  I hope to hear from you soon!

For this project we will be moving 99% of the content from publictutoring.org to acttutoringonline.com. You will notice a large bulk of the work has been completed already but some minor items with allowing New Students to be able to register are currently broken and need to be fixed. 

Goal
To have acttutoringonline.com be the new publictutoring.org, and to shift the focus of publictutoring.org away from driving ACT course enrollment conversions and more towards the initiative of a free courses being provided to needy student who would have otherwise not had the opportunity to get the help they would have needed. Help that puts them much closer to that ACT score that brings them that much closer to the reality of making their wildest dreams come true! After the migration is completed ACTtutoringonline.com will become the only site of the 2 that processes the course enrollment transactions and this domain will obviously be the primary focus hints to the amount of content that will exist on it versus PublicTutoring.org. PublicTutoring.org will exist only as the central hub for the Initiative of giving back to needy students.  In conclusion, when all is said and done Publictutoring.org will collect contact-us leads and will be purely lead-gen and ACTtutoringonline.com will also collect contact-us leads but in addition will process the Course Enrollment transactions like publictutoring.org used to.


Specifications & Guidelines
•	Which Pages or specific text will move from publictutoring.org to acttutoringonline? 
o	99% of the content that currently exists on publictutoring.org will be moved to actutoringonline.com. 
•	To save time and cost and to simplify this migration we will move over all content except the following URLs:
•	/a-benefit-corporation/
•	tablets
•	Will any pages show on both sites? 
•	The traditional footer pages will show on both sites (/privacy-policy/, /user-agreement/, /contact-us/, /faq/ & Blog)
•	Which Pages/Content Stay on PublicTutoring.org? 
o	The only content or pages that will remain on publictutoring.org  that are currently there right now will be the full pages that currently only exist in the footer and the text on the /a-benefit-corporation/ page:
•	/privacy-policy/
•	/user-agreement/
•	/contact-us/
•	/faq/
•	Blog
•	Tablets
•	The content on http://publictutoring.org/a-benefit-corporation/ 
•	This content will need to be moved to the publictutoring.org homepage after all the other content from publictutoring.org is moved over to acttutoringonline.com.
•	The new format of the publictutoring.org site’s homepage will contain a slider in the banner section and a similar homepage flow to kinf.org. 
•	We will have 3-5 images on the slider max and these images will be provided once we reach this stage of the project. 
•	What will happen with the old Public Tutoring.org site from an overall framework standpoint after the content is migrated to ACTtutoringonline.com site?
o	For the most part we will follow the instructions above of which URLs will stay and we will follow the same format that is in place now. The only major change will be the homepage itself which will have an upgrade with the addition of an image slider that will show some needy students, another image about SIMPLE as a company or Mauri, in addition to a CTA to the ACT Tutoringonline.com site in a 3rd slide. 
•	What type of look are we going for, are there any examples? 
•	Here are some organizations that are ranking well in organic search for giving back to needy students, I really like KINF.org's approach and think we can use a slider as well with a similar leading image with the needy students like they have on their kinf.org homepage.";Web Development;Site Migration;http://www.upwork.com/jobs/~013f94638539a39309;10-30 hrs/week;4;1

Being able to animate, and bend the DOM to your will is a big requirement. WebGL experience a plus.

Frontend is most important for this role, but you should also be comfortable enough to build CRUD apps using Laravel/Rails or something similar.

Experience with git is also highly preferred.

So far, the web front has been handled by myself, the founder. However, moving forward, I need to delegate this off to someone else so that I can focus on growing the company.

We are therefore looking to hire a part time developer who can manage the front end and backend of the website. Currently, and for the foreseeable future, the website is very simple.

The front-facing pages are used to persuade people to invest, and the backend is simply a shopping basket which facilitates the transfer of monies to our segregate account, via Stripe.

While this is currently operating as a shell on Wordpress and WooCommerce, long term it would be good to have a more sleak system built on Drupal etc, however this is not an immediate need. 

The immediate need is to have someone who can design the front end of the website, and work with the Marketing Director and Communications Director to improve the look and functionality of the website.

We need a candidate who is like like myself; a geek, passionate about IT, and a great team player. While we will soon be getting offices, we appreciate you may wish to work from home.

The back-end system is hosted in a HA cololcation data-centre using equipment owned by Propertons. As these servers power all business operations bar email,  and as we work within a regulated industry, we need someone who can demonstrate working within strict security settings. 

The ideal candidate will understand that budgets are tight and will be excited at the thought of growing with the startup through our further rounds of funding.

Now I am in need of a mobile app developer 'Team' to finish a project that was designed by someone else but is just not stable. This team (It's amazing how many people claim to have done this, and how many times I have ran this ad) would be a company that is especially good experience with 'GPS'. Also with Codeigniter, Linyx, port configurations etc. And of course iOS/Android mobile and both tablet and iPad app development. 

This app has 4 main features and works cross platform on phones. It works almost like 'Uber' or 'Life360' where you can see the driver coming to you, or track the person/client etc and also has a panic button which sends an sms of your exact location, and calls the police. It works also on tablets/iPads for the 'Open House Point Feature' but does not track these devices which seems to be one of the hurdles), makes appointments with prospective clients and more.

Please read the attachment and also watch the videos at pinpointappointment.com for how it is supposed to work. There are ‘Users’, ‘Friends’ and ‘Clients’ that use the app:

The site consists the front-end, back-end and content-management system. Must be familiar with meteor.js, angular.js, bootstrap and preferably one CMS on Meteor such as OrionJS (orionjs.org).

I have existing front-end static html template with bootstrap already. It contains a single html page and blog pages. I want to be able to manage the single page content using CMS and prefers to manage the blog using meteor blog package (https://github.com/meteor-blog/meteor-blog)

I also have a basic meteor template for the back-end as well. However, contents are static right now, which I would like to covert to use MongoDB. Sample json files will be included for the MongoDB. The site should also be constructed with auto-publish and insecure package off, which currently it is not.

Google Analytics should be provided using this add-on: meteor add nicolaslopezj:orion-ga

SEO enhancement is provided using this add-on: meteor add rwatts:orionjs-gtm 

I will share the detailed software requirement doc, front-end functional html pages (constructed using bootstrap template), back-end functional meteor starter pages (also constructed using bootstrap template), sample json files with you once you are short-listed.

While you will need to understand bootstrap, LESS, the design for the site is mostly done and should not be your primary concern. But I would need someone who is comfortable of reading existing meteor template codes and make changes per requirement. Also, while the real site content is not ready, my exiting front-end and back-end templates should provide you enough dummy data to construct the site. And I can improve the json files provided as needed.

The job will be hourly until it is done but we should setup multiple milestones along the way to make sure that you are progressing as expected.

At the moment I’m using Azure Machine learning and I have already used R to perform some data transformations to make my data process and workable with regression models.

The time series data is for a café which sells multiple items. At the moment I have this code:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
chosen <- (df3[df3$item_name == itemS, ])
tH <- table(chosen$Year)
chosen$YearCount <- tH[as.character(chosen$Year)]
tH <- table(chosen$Month)
chosen$MonthCount <- tH[as.character(chosen$Month)]
tH <- table(chosen$WeekY)
chosen$WeekYCount <- tH[as.character(chosen$WeekY)]
tH <- table(chosen$WeekM)
chosen$WeekMCount <- tH[as.character(chosen$WeekM)]
tH <- table(chosen$Day)
chosen$DayCount <- tH[as.character(chosen$Day)]
tH <- table(chosen$Quarter)
chosen$QuarterCount <- tH[as.character(chosen$Quarter)]
tH <- table(chosen$Hour)
chosen$HourCount <- tH[as.character(chosen$Hour)]
tH <- table(chosen$Minute)
chosen$MinuteCount <- tH[as.character(chosen$Minute)]
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This counts the number of times a specific item defined by the ItemS variable occurs within the dataset. 

My question:

If I wanted to score multiple Items, would it be best to create multiple functions and just redefine ItemS for the new functions (such as ItemS1, ItemS2) or would it be better to write a function automatically did the above but just by adding the name? How would this affect performance timings of models? Would it best best to use web parameters to just run the model multiple times for the different items as I'm only able to label one column to predict.

Example:

chosen <- (df3[df3$item_name == itemS, itemS1, items2 ])

I’m going to be doing quite a bit of machine learning work in the coming future and I would really appreciate someone who was familiar with maybe R, Python, Sql, etc to give me some guidance and advice.

Today we are using a client redirect integration; the customer is redirected to the payment processor's portal to complete payment and then returned to our site once payment is completed or failed.

The module needs to be enhanced by using the ""Server Side Direct Connection"" method described in the attached integration guide PDF (page 28). This processor supports several payment methods (credit card, bank transfer, cash payments at 7-11s, etc) - so the payment flow should actually result in two modules - one that takes customers through the credit card payment channel, and the other would go through the processor's site.

Now instead of the customer being directed to a third party site for entering credit card information, they would remain on our site and the data would be transmitted behind the scenes, making checkout much easier for the customer.


We expect the integration to be as seamless and fault-tolerant as possible to maximize the customer experience. For example, failure notices shown to the customer should be accurate, logged to the back end, and allow the customer to try again without losing their cart or checkout progress. Successful payments should automatically create Magento Invoices, transactions, and log payment details for our customer service team to see and work with.

Some expectations we have:

code uses the Magento 2 framework properly and will compile
code will be properly commented for review
independent freelancer, not an agency
Likely other projects ongoing if the fit is good
Strong preference given to those holding Magento 2 certification

Even stronger preference given to those who can show specific examples of payment processor integrations that work as we've described above

We expect expert-level, high quality, documented, readable and supportable code. We expect you to supply your own development resources. However, when you are ready for testing alongside our other modules we can provide access to a development environment on an intermittent basis.

I need some minor changes to an existing website. Go to www.takashina-architect.com. Choose a portfolio category (e.g. Residential, Commercial, etc.) from the left side navigation pane. 
1. The first screen with category title and some text statements in black background:
-1) In the bottom gray description window, you may see [an error occurred while processing this directive.] message. Remove this. This happened in Windows 7, but does not seem to happen in windows 10. Test this with different OS’s;
-2) There is a delta arrow below near the bottom of the black screen to start the slide show for the category. Make the arrow more clearly noticeable, by making them whiter;
-3) In my laptop, this first screen is a little too long/tall, so that I have to scroll down a little to see the arrow. Make the entire image adjusted to show up in full so that you do not have to scroll down to see the arrow, no matter what size of display screen a viewer is using.
2. When the arrow is clicked, a slide show for the project begins. Right now when a category is chosen, the slide show repeats for the first project in the selected category. Change it so that slide show goes to the 2nd, then, 3rd, etc projects in the category, and when all projects within a category are shown, it comes back to the beginning project of the category and repeat the whole process unless the viewer interrupts. 
3. At the upper left side of the slide screen with black background, there is a tab (with the selected category name) that, when clicked, lists all projects within the category, allowing to navigate to different project within the category. 
-1) Make the tab more clearly noticeable by changing the font of the text in the tab bold; 
-2) The listing of projects that show up when you click the tab is in a table format, each project in a rectangular box. Make the white outline of the box thicker if the project is being slide-showed at that time. So, the thicker outline moves to the next project as slide show shifts to the next project.
4: At the upper right side of the slide screen with black background, there is a tab that shows x/y, in which x is the number of the slide just being shown and y is the total # of slides in the project. When you click it, a band of slides will appear.
-1) Make the tab more clearly noticeable by changing the font of the text in the tab bold (similar to -3 above); 
-2) In the band of slides, make the white outline of the slide thicker if the slide is being shown at that time.
5: Change the copyright year to 2017.
6: Make this Web site better fit and usable with smartphones.

This job is quite complex. I'm not sure this brief is 100% finished. I would love to talk through this project on skype if possible. 

Plugins
- Buddypress
- Buddypress Member Types Pro (buddydev)
- Woocommerce
- woocommerce memberships
- woocommerce subscriptions

I am open to buying more plugins if they are well built, and will help with the project. This job needs to be completed as quickly as possible!!!

In summation here it is 
(first part)
- We're running the site on different member types (using your plugin)
- We need each of the members to have different profile fields, and for some of them to be pulled through to the individual member directory, and for some of them to be searchable by profile fields, and their location (one of the fields)
- I need to limit some of their 'add friend' and 'messaging' permissions. 
- adding the profile picture and notifications to the menu bar

(second part)
One of the member types is 'nannies' or childcare professionals. We would like to add the ability for the nannies to add badges to their profile. The badges work like this
- They have 5 badges that are 'greyed' out for everyone
- The badges show when the user is logged in, in the menu bar, and they show for all the nannies on the nanny directory
- When they click the badges on their profile page, they are faced with 2 options. One is to upload the relevant document, and the other is to purchase the relevant document. If they click the upload document they have to go through to a payment screen where they pay to upload the document. If they click the purchase document page they get sent to a URL which we manually assign for each badge (and therefore document upload)
- When they pay for the upload they can then go in a upload the document at any time
- They must be able to download that document from their profile login page. 
- The 5 badges are split into 2 payment groups. first 2 badges cost £10 for both and the last 3 cost £20 for all 3

I would like to use Stripe as the payment gateway. Ideally, for all payments, we would use the stripe popup function. I think the stripe gateway for woocommerce enables this function out of the box. 

Please use the word 'miegroup' at the start of your proposal so I know you've read the whole brief.

I have been writing code for over 20 years, you can see my github (https://github.com/darrynten) and my stackoverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/users/618172/darryn-ten) accounts to get a better idea of who I am and what I do. I also mentor several developers currently. 

I've started something new and exciting, I'm looking for help, so you can consider this task a paid test :)

I need help with a PHP client that I've been developing for the SageOne Accounting API, which is open-source MIT licensed, and actively being developed in the open.

Details

* Already on github
* Has 100% test coverage for existing code
* Is fully PSR-2 compliant
* Has Travis, CodeClimate, Codacy, Codecov, Var.CI and Clean CI integration. 
* The only dependency is guzzle
* Supports 7.0+

Full details on the project here: https://github.com/darrynten/sage-one-php

You would be working with me and the rest of my team using a gitflow technique, with branches, atomic commits, and pull requests that have status checks and we will remain in contact via slack. All diagrams will be shared via LucidChart.

The deliverables section is what is required for the initial run.

There will be 2 interns working on the project too, and you would also need to review their PRs when they open them. They're there to help you get the job done sooner rather than later. Your PRs would come through me or another Senior with approval rights.

There are templates for the Models, for the ModelTests, and for the Mocks in the repo (you can see the README.md for info on that).

We have extremely high standards, and there are many PR/Push checks to assist you in delivering world class code.

You will receive full recognition in the README, and it's always nice to have solid open-source contributions, as they definitely assist with career advancement.

The reason I'm funding the building of this open source project (with my measly rands) is that I have a main product that uses Accounting providers, like Sage and Xero.

There is another project just like this that is in development, and will be open sourced (and will have work available on it) in roughly a week from now. This project is fixed price but if we work well together then there is the possibility to come onto hourly contract with us.

I've been doing this for so long and I love open source and I'm working on something exciting so I thought to myself, why not spend a little bit to incentivise the project. Since it's not out there then we must be the ones to get it out there :)

I'm really passionate about the field and what I do, I've been coding for over 20 years and I'm really just looking for other good devs to work with.

I look forward to hearing from you :)

The indicator involves displaying the cumulative of each direction up and down on the chart. See the attached photo for a better idea. What is also essential is being able to divided the current ""leg"" volume by the previous ""leg"" volume; and use this number in my strategy. I need this ""number"" to be able to be used in Ninjascript just like I would be able to use any other common indicator if an ""EMA"" or ""SMA"" or ""High"" or ""Close"".  

Generally speaking, here is more detailed description of what I am looking for. 

My idea would be that the user chooses a 'leg strength' i.e. the left side of a swing strength. My preference is 5. So let's call it LS = 5. 

Then, when a bar is higher than the previous 5 bars to the left, the real time cumulative volume is calculated and 'painted' above the current bar's high. We can call this Volume, V0 as seen in the attached photos. 

If the next bar goes higher, then V0 gets updated to add the current bar's volume and painted over this new, higher bar. This continues until the bars do not get any higher. 

Now, when the next bar has a lower high, the painted V0 stays on top of the previous bar and is still labeled V0.  

Next, when the bars continue to move downward, when the first bar has a lower low than the previous 5 bars to the left, a new V0 will form, and the previous V0 will now be labeled V1. The new V0 will paint the real time cumulative volume from one bar after (to the right of) the bar at V1 to the current bar, which is current point V0. If the bars continue to go lower, then V0 will continue to be painted under the current bar. 

One more criteria, if the high of V0 is greater than the high of V2, then the volume should be painted green. if the high of V0 is less than the high of V2, then the volume should be painted red. 

And if the low of V0 is less than the low of V2, then the volume should be painted red. If the low of V0 is greater than the low of V2, then the volume should be painted green. 

This also applies to the relationship of V1 and V3, with how the volumes should be painted for their colors

And to get my volume ratio strategy criteria, we divide V1/V0, if it is greater than 3, then that condition is met. I would like to have the option to display this in the lower right corner of the chart as seen in one of the attached photos. 

And one last criteria; If the Volume should be ""painted"" red, then I would like the volume to be multiplied by ""-1"". 

Thank you.

We provide Transport Administration (package shipping) solutions for Swedish ecommerce shops. We are looking for more talent to help us expand with more shipping providers.

So now we are hiring an individual freelancer to code full support for interacting with a shipping company known as Bring Citymail.

At Stidner, we use a microservice architecture; this specific project will be using the Laravel framework, and communication to-and-from the microservice will be as a JSON REST API.

The scope of this project will to make the functionality of these type of API endpoints:
1. API for giving price quotes, based on given weight of package
2. API for registering shipments (save information into a shipment queue, which is later used to notify the transport company of new shipments)
3. API for creating/downloading shipping labels (uses information from above shipping queue)
4. API for sending announcement file (""ships"" the pending packages from shipment queue)
5. API for tracking packages, which relays from Bring's XML API


Technical side behind each of the above:
1. No external requests. Take input (package weight + postcode), and return a price based on weight of package (predefined pricelist)
2. No external requests. Take input (basic information about the shipment - addresses and weight), and return a shipment ID.
3. No external requests. Take input (shipment ID), and create/return pdf shipment label.
4. Create an XML file (based on the information from unsent packages in queue), and SFTP it to the ""shipments"" folder on Citymail's remote servers.
5. Request Citymail's remote XML-webservice with a given shipment ID, and return the tracking events (reformatted into json).


Full documentation will be provided by us for the above tasks. We want the developer to build architecture and write code according to the guidelines used in our company. All the guidelines will be sent before the work starts.

Then it should be converted into a CSV and saved to the client machine where the script is running (Windows 7 professional). 

When?
The CSV-file should be updated automatically every x hours and on demand. The update should be done by replacing the existing CSV-file by an updated version of the same name.

How many?

The Beeminder service (https://www.beeminder.com/) tracks a user's progress towards their goals using triggers from various other services, for example:

- Duolingo for language learning
- Garmin for running

I want my Gym attendance to create a trigger for Beeminder. My Gym logs all members attendance at the Gym in an online members area (puregym.com/members/activity/) Note that the activity log is behind a username & password.

What I want to acheive:

IF a new attendance is logged on my account at puregym.com/members/activity/
THEN a trigger is sent to my related goal in my Beeminder account 

I suspect that this would be possible by, for example:

1. A regular scrape of puregym.com/members/activity/
2. Populate a Google spreadsheet with that data.
3. Create an applet in IFTTT that reads that spreadsheet and creates a Beeminder trigger if there is a new column.

You can find other examples of IFTTT applets that connect to Beeminder on this page:
https://ifttt.com/beeminder

I believe this should be possible using a similar method to the one described above but I lack the time and the expertise to make it happen. Also, if you can think of a simpler solution please let me know!

Let me know if you are interested or if you have further questions.

thanks,

This data is freely available via http://ergast.com/mrd/query/ and can be accessed via either xml or json - whichever is easier to use as we don't have a preference. An example xml feed of what we need is here. http://ergast.com/api/f1/current/driverStandings - this xml would be typically inserted into wordpress and presented as a table, which can be called upon either via a shortcode and a widget. What is needed from the above site is:

Season Calendar: http://ergast.com/api/f1/2017
Driver Standings: http://ergast.com/api/f1/current/driverStandings
Constructors Standings: http://ergast.com/api/f1/current/constructorStandings

As a widget, the 3 tables would be available in the same space, separated only via tabs. Attached is an example of how another site does it and this is exactly the final look we want, or close to.

the idea is that we can updated the link to the API so that we can show details for the latest season etc.. which would be made available via an options screen in the backend.

The second part of this project would be a countdown timer to the next race, as present in the feed. the countdown timer would simply display the next Race's name, along with days, hours and minutes to go. an example of this can also be found attached. 

We don't mind doing some CSS ourselfs as long as you can get the data and tabs working and updating properly.

The feed would only need to be updated weekely but will be ideal to have an option to change update frequency to whatever we need (this updates the points in the table after every race etc)

Notice that with the calendar tab, it would be good to have a space to put a button that allows users to buy tickets for that event. Maybe this can be a place holder as the template is already designed to handle buttons and other layouts by default.

Are you an experienced developer?

Do you have design skills?

Are you familiar with SEO?

So here's the deal. Right now one of my sites comes up with a 503 error, but only sometimes. If you load it 20 times, probably 3 out of 20 you will find the 503 error code, and its on multiple pages ranging from blog posts to product pages.

So this is my immediate concern, but if you can fix this, I have additional work for you. There are some other issues that I have been meaning to get fixed, that could be affecting our SEO. I would want to see if you could find the issues without me telling you, and then I can hire you to fix these additional issues. If you can do all of this, I will be very happy and want to hire you for similar issues but on other sites we own.  I am looking for a long-term developer to be available when we need. Now not all developers can also design landing pages. If you have an eye for design as well and have a successful track record of designing landing pages that convert at a high ratio, well then I have lots of work for you, so that's just an extra plus.

The purpose of the ANN module is to learn patterns/trading setups that my indicator recognizes, store the patterns into a database.

The process:

Phase 1. Learning.
The robot runs its routine also and spots a trading signal.
The robot places an order (buy/sell) and sets stop(if indicated) and take profit levels.
If the trade is successful (the price hits the take profit level) the ANN module learns the pattern
There are 4 types of patterns only.

Phase 2. Trading.
The robot runs its routing and spots a trading signal.
The robot matches the pattern/setup forming the signal to patterns stored in the database.
If the pattern is matched to one of the patterns in the database the robot places an order
If the order is successful the pattern is added to the database according to its type.

The Artificial Neural Network module
It is a basic three-layer backpropagation image recognition convolutional ANN. Inputs from the chart play the role of inputs for an image in an ANN.


Therefore are two options to implement the process
1. A new robot is created. The code of the new robot should call the robot that I already have and obey commands(orders) from my main robot.
2. The ANN module is included in the main robot. In this case, full instructions should be provided as the source code of the robot will not be provided.

The submitted code must be well-commented. An additional explanatory paper might be required to provide instructions how the ANN module should be included in the main code. The source code of my robot can not be revealed.

1. About Us – It is astounding, the number of companies that do not have an about us page on their website. This is one of the most important pages and for a company this is one of the best pages to reach out to your clients and tell them who and what you are about.

An About Us page should usually comprise of the following:

who we are and how long we have been in business
what we provide summarising the products and services
why we are the company to deal with
when we can assist you and information about project time lines etc.
how to contact us and start doing business with us
Mention some clients that have utilized your product or service, hyperlinking to their website. Essentially this is the page where you toot your horn and get visitors interested. Remember to make sure that the About Us page is written according to your company’s image for example, corporate, or relaxed etc.
2. Contact Us – There is no point in spending money on a brilliant website, if we don’t make sure of 2 things in relation to our contact us page:

that our contact us page (link to it) is clearly and obviously visible on our home page
that our contact us page actually works
These 2 factors may seem quite logical but I have seen hundreds of companies whose contact us page simply doesn’t work. You take the time to find it (again note the visibility issue) and then you fill it in, press submit and you get an error notification. This is the quickest way to tell people that you are unprofessional, slack and very careless. This is also the fastest way that a visitor will decide not to use us.
3. FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) – This page is so often overlooked by website designers and developers as well as website owners alike. Yet it is probably one of the best sales tools you have on your website.

Here we can go on and on about how wonderful your product is, how brilliant it is with helping people, and how you are the best people to use for the supply thereof.

We can also assist people with understanding our product, learning about our company and above all else supplying them with information so that by the time they call you, they are already rather inclined to use your product or service as they know all about you.

4. Products – Many people take for granted the fact that their visitors know about their product or service before they enter their site. This is completely wrong!

Whilst visitors may have a general idea of what our product or service is they do not know the particulars about it in any way shape or form. So it is imperative to have a page called products (or services) and therein you provide an index page of your various products or services that you supply as well as a general short write up of each of your products.

This is a brilliant SEO tool as it assists websites with keyword density and it also gives people a quick overview of exactly what we supply and how we can serve them.

Where we will upload the image or small video of the i.d card holder into the database and one i.d proof of that person, then app should be able to detect the face of the person and verify that person's photo and his photo i.d proof is same.

App should be able to detect colors, weather, activities and moments also through live CCTV Camera feed.

Our professional users should be able to use this technology to find suspects within sometime of an incident, out of thousands of hours of footage from diverse camera feeds. This same accuracy is now available to your home and business customers to make their own video footage more useful, usable and relevant.

We need these features to be added into our app.

We want that app shud be connected to CCTV cameras in Mall and Hotels and it shud recognize the face of visiters and shud tell us the exact count of people visiting there by giving a number to each visitor.

There shud be an option of Ekyc verification in the app by connecting some APIs of Driving License of UIDAI.

Where an i.d or address proof will be uploaded and it will fetch the information from database and show us the results that this i.d proof and address is genuine or fake.

We should be able to have the automatic ability to classify and refine query results by object types, such as people, vehicles, packages, etc.

Handling complex lighting conditions on the fly.

Every scene is different- we’ve developed the capacity over the years to handle thousands of scenes.

Lighting conditions and weather conditions for example (you’d be surprised how snow and rain impacts the accuracy of computer vision!).

Detecting subtle and camouflaged objects.

We can identify very small subtle objects, down to the level of small creature. and, while an object in the frame that is appearing against a background of the same color is a difficult task – over the years, our detection has become very sensitive to subtle differences in color and texture.

Knowing what goes together to create a single incident.

If a person “disappears” from the frame for a period of several seconds, as they pass behind a car or a tree, we detect that and treat it as one incident. If the person goes in and out of the frame boundaries, we treat it as separate object incidents.

Extended capabilities through third party metadata.

We connect video time stamps to metadata from other systems to create tight custom integrations.

For example, if you have an ID badge system in your small business application, we can pair that information to video.

The same goes with audio feeds, motion sensors, smoke detectors and more.

There should be an admin account and user account.

Admin should be able to monitor any user account parallelly.

Admin should have rights to add or remove any user.

There should be a key from Admin side and after submitting that key only, user account will be activated.

We need to embed the app on our drone and will take it towards some public meeting and app shud be able to recognise the number of people available in crowd and recognise their face.

Not only do you have the alert from the third party feed, but the video of what happened at that exact moment, along with more efficient presentation and rich query formulation capabilities.

a) Image with minimum face resolution of 50x50 pixels.

b) JPEG image format.

c) Images with different lighting conditions.

d) Images with face angle variation of +/- 30 degrees from frontal in Yaw, Pitch and Roll.

f) Face images with beards, moustaches, moles, marks and make-up with different ancillaries.

g) Face images for different age groups like children, adults and old aged.

h) Color images and Black & White images

So now we are hiring an individual freelancer to code full support for interacting with the shipping company called Schenker.

At Stidner, we use a microservice architecture; this specific project will be using the Laravel framework, and communication to-and-from the microservice will be as a JSON REST API.

The scope of this project will to make the functionality of these type of API endpoints:
1. API for giving price quotes, based on given weight of package
2. API for giving delivery time information, based on sender and recipient postcode.
3. API for registering shipments (save information into a shipment queue, which is later used to notify the transport company of new shipments)
4. API for creating/downloading shipping labels (uses information from above shipping queue)
5. API for sending announcement file (""ships"" the pending packages from shipment queue)
6. API for tracking packages.
7. API for booking pickups.
8. API for getting servicepoint locations.


Technical side behind each of the above:
1. External XML-webservice. Take input (package weight + postcode), and returns the result reformatted as json.
2. External XML-webservice. Basically same as #1.
3. No external requests. Take input (basic information about the shipment - addresses and weight), and return a shipment ID.
4. No external requests. Take input (shipment ID), and create/return pdf shipment label.
5. Create an EDI file (IFTMIN), based on the information from unsent packages in queue, and FTP it to Schenker's remote servers.
6. Request Schenker's remote XML-webservice with a given shipment ID, and return the tracking events (reformatted into json).
7. External XML-webservice. Has basic information about where Schenker should drive to, and how many packages are being booked for pickup.
8. External XML-webservice. Input is with postal code, and returns list of closest servicepoints (places where packages can be picked up)

Because of #5, it's highly appreciated (but not required) that you have former experience working with EDI/IFTMIN!

We are looking for a very professional high level WooCommerce Developer. 

Your Job will be to create 2 WooCommerce Stores. Nutrition/Fitness Market!

The first shop is only temporary for 1-2 months and has about 1200 different products. Temporary because we are building a more complex shop template right now but we need to launch it pretty soon.

The second is only for 1 single product so it should be very design focused.

Both stores are targeting the german market. They will be plugged into the ""JTL Wawi"" which is a warehouse management system. There is a free connector available for WooCommerce 2, also for Woocommerce 3 but this connector is only in the BETA. So we prefer WooCommerce 2 because of the connector!

A very professional look of the stores is absolutly neccessary! The designs have to be clean, modern and worthy.

Second thing is a Salesfunnel, build with WooCommerce with which it is possible to create a 1-Click Upsell after the customer ordered the first product. So we need:
1st Landingpage with customer data entry form
2nd page will be the checkout
3rd page will be the 1st upsell
 + additional upsells and downsells and thank you pages

What is crucial here, everything what the customer buys throughout the whole salesfunnel   should be put in 1 order in woocommerce so that the connector can synchronize it with our warehouse management system.

So we need a buy buttons that are connected to specific products. If you are familiar with salesfunnels you will now what i mean (hopefully)  ;)

So we will just need WooCommerce in this case to load the orders into our warehouse management system, nothing more, so there are no fancy store templates needed.

For a real expert these tasks should not be a big deal, right? 

We only work with the best! Please send us references, this will not be the last projects, we need additional stores in the future. 

If you are the right one, please send your application NOW!

Design is ready.

I have a need to create E-Commerce site similar to
https://www.mcmaster.com

I need to create it using Ajax-Cart.com - you will receive help for learning the platform. Look for demo and admin area. Download free and look in code.

Project cost is I think not over $3000. Look on McMaster through categories - there are many categories with different fields.

Design is ready. You will need to integrate design so Ajax pages are not broken just works like Ajax Cart do.

Some filters are there. I believe you better to create extra fields management. Filter by these extra fields. Also assign extra fields to categories - so each category has own fields just like on McMaster.

Once you finish with development, we can hire you for data entry work which is around another $500-$1000. We have lot of manufacturers files in PDF or Excel format.

You will need to talk with my boss and work with him directly.

I think best way to create custom fields management per category. Next products will have these custom fields on new product modify tab. Customer area will also display fields by category - on columns and on filter. Last two options can be checkboxes selected or not to show or not.

I have a domain where we website will be soon, but in the meantime, I have the need for a simple web-based underwriting program to help aid in valuing real estate I work with.  
The web-based program will be based on an excel spreadsheet that has gone through many iterations over the years.

My requirements for the app are as follows:

Infrastructure Requirements:
•	Web Based (a given)
•	Constructed with a programming language that has a lot of flexibility for future incorporation and implementation into other tools.
•	The ability to enter the app through a login on the website (or domain)
•	The ability to save the work for future editing, and save different copies of said file.
•	Ability to export the whole underwriting into a workbook with individual sheets to Excel for further editing and manipulation.
Content Requirements:
•	Clean layout that is easy to read. 
•	Space to enter in all of the property information.
•	Some base forms setup based on information entered on the front end (i.e. 5 unit building, the rent roll automatically adds 5 lines to enter in each unit’s information which can be locked up front. But also the ability to add an additional line for non-legal units that are physically part of the structure but not recognized by a financial institution who would be underwriting the property for purposes of extending credit.)
•	Ability to add and subtract lines for different types of income and expenses while keeping calculations intact.  This would be a must for two-three pages of the underwriting.
•	An admin page that allows the user to edit the variables:
o	Specific to the property type (i.e. for apartments: insurance expense/unit, repairs and maintenance estimates, etc.)
o	Specific to that municipality, i.e. fees and taxes specific to the city for which the property is located.  
•	A page with footnotes detailing all the variables 
•	A page that details the first mortgage information as well as the payment schedule.

I am currently looking for a designer/developer to continue with a job that has been left unfinished. I was working with a designer whom I recently had to let go of (lack of communication and unreliability...) so I have a web project thats basically 2/3 done. I do already have my brand identity, and some brand collateral which I am very happy with. All of my web pages have been designed on Adobe Illustrator and are created for a custom WordPress theme. I'm looking for a designer / developer who has a great design eye and marketing background that is able to work with what I already have, and help successfully bring it to life! 

An interest and understanding of the wellness industry is very welcome. 

I would say this job is about 20% design, 80% development. 

I do not have a strict deadline with this project right now, but I would like to have it wrapping up in the final 2 weeks of August. 

I will also need a brief lesson on how to work the back end / update my website when the project is finished (i.e. blog posts, image changes, etc.) 

My website has a landing page up at the moment, which will hold the space until I am able to finish the entire website -- www.thewellnessrefinery.com 

I would be very happy if there were a designer in Toronto who fit this job posting who is willing to meet up in person to discuss the project. If this isn't the case, I am open to working with someone remotely as long as there is clear communication and a common understanding of ideas :) 

It would also be great if this were a connection to continue with, so as to work on possible future web development projects. 

Thanks!!

The tag-line is ""For Photos that matter"".  Potential clients are real estate, fashion, and financially capable but technologically uninformed personal users. 

I am looking for someone that can take what it is that I want to do and utilize the various tools out there to make it happen; someone who thinks outside of the box.

MUSTS: mobile friendly/responsive.  Clean design.  Ideal if the website has scrolling effect, like one long page so that all information is right in front of the user. 

I would like the candidate to be able to show me other websites that have the aesthetic and functionality that I want so that I know what I will be getting at the end of the day…no surprises!!!  The ideal candidate will also have experience with or works with someone that could create an app at a later date.

Page 1: Landing Page with description/examples and “Get started” button that allows user to create an account with their name and email, and then immediately start. All email addresses are integrated into an email collection system that saves their information allows me to batch email at a later date Mail Chimp

Page 2: Upload module will upload to my server (dropbox, google drive or something that you recommend).  With the images I need the client's user information in order to send them back their images.  Upload module (drag and drop or explore) and the process in which images go from client and back to client,  will be the most important.  Just like ebay allows you to add images via your cell phone (ebay notification appears on your cell phone that allows you to add images from your “gallery” (this could be phase II)

Needs to be clean and self-explanatory.  All image types and sizes will need to be allowed.  

The system must be able to check to make sure that the images are appropriate image types and sizes (notified users if image is too small) and not spam/junk/viruses.  Spam and viruses have always been an issue so you need to have significant security (captcha) experience uploading opens the doors for bots.

Page 3:
Tips and tricks/Blog.  This is going to be a page that tells people best practices and will be updated personally weekly.  People need to be able to subscribe.  All posts should be integrated with facebook and other social media so that I don’t need to post in multiple places

This will be our MVP and while it is not thought off as a finished version it must be build for scalability and with a quality where future inhouse developers can take it further. 

Our website should be based on Wordpress. It is also be based on a theme - theme already decided. The theme will need an amount of customization. 

We expect 10-12 unique pages. 5-6 of them will need UX, while the rest of the pages can be based on just modified theme pages.  

We need integration to Chargebee (subscription software - chargebee.com) and Chargebee to Stripe (payment gateway). We will initially use Chargebee hosted pages for billing (sign up) and customer portal (log in). 

There might be a need for a bit of Chargebee hosted pages customization assistance, but most we expect to able to handle ourselves. Key functions in Chargebee integrations like sign up, payments  etc must be tested and validated. 

Tracking codes for Google Analytics, Mixpanel, FB pixel, SEMRush and Hotjar must be implemented. 

Intercom integration to wordpress and some event tracking in Chargebee hosted pages flow. (Tracking sign up to identify members) 

Plugin installations like YoastSEO and other key WP plugins. 

A check-in / check-out ""page"" that our hospitality managers can use on the coworking locations to check in and out members. The page must resemble the theme and we think the check in should be done by: entering mobilephone number - query to chargebee - validate that phonenumber match member=sign in - register (event) in Intercom that the member has checked in. Checkout should just be an event in intercom based on an interaction on the checkout page.  

Finally we would also appreciate hosting setup (could be a wp managed hosting solution) and optimization for speed and security.  
Must of course be responsive (theme is), work across browsers, have SEO fundamentals in order. UI and debugging must be done.

We are developing a new application to manage Contacts - this is a very simple CRM app, with ~4 screens, and only 3 database tables.  However, If this project works out we would like you to work with us long term as we enhance this project and add additional features.

You Must have strong knowledge in developing Laravel 5 web apps with a database backend (MySql) and also be good at javascript.

You will not need to be a designer, or do design work, but must be able to implement front end UI based on a design or template  you are provided.

We are looking for a rockstar developer who can get to work right away and understands the full lifecycle of developing web apps.  You must be able to complete work end to end based on specifications, test your work, and deliver great code into the repo (we use github).

You will be provided detailed specs (we're developers too - we understand how important good instructions are!) and you will OWN the development process.

We don't care what hours you work, as long as we are able to sync on skype 1-2 times a week to sync on things.  You must also be a great communicator and be able to provide feedback in text or voice calls.

Please send details on any web sites or projects you have worked on. To make sure we know you have read and understand these requirements, make sure the first line of your response says ""I'm a rockstar Laravel 5 developer!"".  Applications that do not include these items will be deleted. Thanks.

Please let us know why you are a fit for this project, and what you are bringing to the team - we'd love to learn more about YOU.

The specs for this initial project are attached, please review those and submit your bid for this project based on the spec.  If you have questions, let us know.

Initially I am after a bare minimum viable product, limited functionality, to prove a concept, this add is for the MVP only.  If successful the candidate will be the preferred bidder for further work growing the app.

My application will be accessed via web browser on PC, Tablet and mobile.  It will require a relational database at the back end.  The UI must be professional to modern standards.  My preference is to use open source databases and software.  Hosting should be on Amazon web services.  

The basic premise of the software is that a user can capture data on a web form (as you would in access or excel).  This data should then be plotted as various different icons (depending on the nature of the data) onto a canvas (kind of as you can in Visio).  The icons should be sequenced by the user (drag and drop) and linked together by the user.  The relationships from the links should be written into the database so each icon has a record of what is linked sequentially before and after it, resulting in a dependency chain being created, all written back into the database back end.  The same should be true in reverse, if the user manipulates the data, the sequencing in the diagram should be updated too.  

I can provide detailed specifications for the above, however this is intended to give an overview only.

The right applicant should be patient and willing to work on this progressively as a project (I have little time, so there may be days between updates and communications).  Coding may be sporadic.  I will work in a sprint method, where each code effort should demonstrate some functionality, allowing me to assess progress easily.  

As this is a startup effort, there is a restricted budget, as such I am willing to work with up coming talent to help me achieve my goals at a sensible rate.

In the first instance, i am offering a fixed rate to just create an MVP, however I am happy to negotiate around rates thereafter if I move to the next phase.

I am not too concerned about which programming language is used, as long as it is a modern, open standard which is common place for SaaS apps today.

I look forward to hearing from you.";Other - Software Development;Web Application Developer;http://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01259cad60ebdb00a3;;1;1

Initial project requires an in-depth understanding of Quickbooks (QBO) and API integration to create a high level of compatibility in bridging the site with our external accounting system. We are looking for an expeditious time line for website launch with various sub-projects, but are looking to build a long term relationship with freelancer who we can hire to evolve our website, post-launch:

Our current website is: http://neoasisinteriors.com/
We rent and sell furniture to the staging industry.

Additional info:
-We are currently hosting with GreenGeeks
-When we migrated to QBO, we lost our SKUs field and all SKUs are reflected in the QBO Names field - we are attempting to avoid manually imputing SKUs for 1,000 (+) products, but currently our API times out when updating data and inventory from the neOasis Quickbooks system, as a result of the system pulling excessive data from the neOasis Quickbooks “NAME” field as opposed to pulling from the SKU field of said Quickbooks System. Looking for API solution.

Additional work to be done as part of Phase 1 (pre-launch): 
- Required check out fields added (with calendar and restrictions) 
- Web orders to automatically create invoices in QBO 
- Web returns to automatically create credit memos in QBO
- Orders to be made editable by user until 24 prior to ship date (update QBO invoice accordingly)
- Lock feature on order for users
- Mirroring of QBO to Order (item removed/added from QBO invoice, removes/adds item from order)
- Automatic Cart Dumping (with prompt/warning)
- Filter defaults and controls (only shows items on site that have a qty of 1 or more in stock)
*** If possible - existing customers and orders uploaded to individual profiles

Wordpress/Divi Theme

PayPal -- But would like to move to Stripe
FooEvents for their events calendar/event tickets/event management

Their Needs:
- Manage memberships/payments/subscriptions -- I was thinking Stripe is best for this as they will need to export to Quickbooks and Stripe is easy to manage subscriptions.
- Member login/logout
- Member Dashboard (Edit profile/company info, edit billing info/subscription)
- Member Directory
- Be able to email or message their members
- Export reports of their members/contact info

We would also need to import all her current member information (500 members) and then come up with a process to invite them all to the website and change/update their login info. 

You should apply to this job if this is completely familiar to you and you have sent out proposals like this before. I'm also available to chat over Skype/Upwork to discuss more specifics if needed.

We use an open source Python diarisation library to separate speakers in audio tracks. This is used by our product which allows a user to manage their phone conversations. It does a reasonably good job (75%-80% accuracy); however, it has an n^2 memory consumption, which makes it very expensive to run for long phone calls.

We don't have bandwidth to spend tuning this at the moment, so we're looking for a skilled engineer to analyze the algorithm, come up with an alternate approach, and create an open source pull request to the project.

Success criteria:
* No drop in accuracy on a provided set of recordings
* No drop in accuracy on a set of recordings that we hold back and use for internal verification
* Linear or sub linear memory usage

Bonuses for:
* Increase in accuracy
* Speed optimization

Full details will be provided to qualified applications, and we can then agree on a price for the job, and bonus tiers. (Of course our budget is not $1M, but Upwork has no way to allow for bids. Bid the ballpark you think it might cost for now, and we'll negotiate once you've seen full details.)

Uses its own mongodb server

Is a single app that scales across servers
Uses a central database to login users

New users automatically create a new database, and APIs are used to automatically initialize resources in other systems

I've tried to make the information as comprehensive as possible.

Here's what I'm wanting:
A UX that is a bit similar to audiojungle.net, but not as busy or as many features. It should have a very clean look. Bearing in mind that it's only two authors selling on the site.

FRONT PAGE
* Prominent search box
* Categories at the top with dropdowns for sub-categories
* Rows of various categories (which can be changed by the website owner)
* Icons of each product. The icon must have a preview player on it, to allow the user to preview the audio (which could possibly loop).
* May or may not have prices displayed
* The option to have a banner to announce a sale/other announcements if necessary.

CATEGORY PAGES
* List of tracks, along with the facility to search within results/categories

PRODUCT PAGE
* Should have a bigger player (with hopefully a scrollable waveform) to allow the user to preview the audio. Add to cart, buy now - along with track details (created, bit rate, sample rate, track length, bpm, tags etc).
* The ability to embed youtube videos
* Cross-selling underneath

SORTING / TAG FILTERS
* Searches, categories must allow user to sort by various things like ""newest/oldest/best selling/low to high""

PRODUCTS
* The music/audio/FX on sale will be in a zip file, which will be hosted on a cloud drive.
* There will always be a preview .mp3 file associated with each track (to allow the user to hear the product 

PAYMENT GATEWAY
* Paypal. Currency is GBP (£)

DESIGN
* This is important. It has to look good, so will be wanting to see a rough idea of what you think you'd be able to achieve with your bid.

SEARCH
* Full search of tracks on the site (not the blogs or news items - that search facility can be on a separate page)
* Search results list with icons (with players over them) - along with name, short description, price. Number of items within the search

UX
* The theme has to be responsive and work with all major browsers

SOCIAL MEDIA
* Shareable icons on products 

CHECKOUT
* Simple checkout. No logging in required.
* Customers should also be able to re-download their orders after a given set amount of time.  

TAGS
* Tracks will be searchable by tags (fast, slow corporate etc), as well as other tags such as duration, bpm (beats per minute), artist - and more (to be decided).

HOSTING
* I currently use cloud web hosting

BOTTOM OF PAGES (FOOTER)
* Should have link to terms, copyright, FAQ

NON-PRODUCT PAGES/BLOGS
* Clean pages to write blog posts, but with the ability to add audio files and youtube videos.

OTHER INFORMATION
* Fast
* SEO optimised
* Secure
* The site must look professional and have a good, clean design. 
* Logos will be provided.  
* Must have integration with a cookie content plugin 

During the initial build and launch, there must be some form of support from yourselves to iron out any bugs.

There should also be a product search box at the top of every page (doesn't need to be as large as the front page search).

I've uploaded an image of a page to show you what I mean about having a player over the icon/image.  I would like more images/products on the page.

There is already a site, but don't mind starting again

I'm looking for a developer who can assist with direction around language, platform, DB and front end architecture.  The only stipulation is that I'd like the app to run inside the amazon AWS environment, using elastic beanstalk to allow for growth.

Initially the site will consist of the following.

Content areas:
- Home page
- An article list (dynamic list of articles)
- A set of articles
- A contact form
- A product selection page (not a shop, just a single page of content)
- A page with a list of features

Then, functionality for the following:
- Login
- Signup
- Collect/store payment information (Credit card, managed through stripe)
- Profile page

Once logged in the user will land on a portfolio page where they can view existing campaigns they've created and create new campaigns.  The site is selling advertising, so each campaign is an advertising campaign.

They'll also have a reports page to analyse their spend on campaigns.

This is a company/contact web harvest project.

First, we need to harvest the list of companies from this website:

SIC = 84

Second, obtain the peopleID from each of those companyIDs:

Third, obtain the people information based on those peopleIDs.  

This won't give full information, but that's okay.  Attached is a document that describes the process more fully.

I believe they use Cloudfare as a protection service, so you will have to go slow or figure out what random cadence to use to not trigger blockages.  We can buy proxy packages if necessary.

Would like the script to be flexible that we can use again in the future with different SIC code.

If this works well, we will have some other harvesting projects available.

We're looking for a seasoned front-end developer to take our PSD files and turn them into a web page on our WP site. I’ve included a link to the PSD files and page assets.  

JOB DETAILS:

Pixel Perfect:
Dev must be able to make the web page reflect the PSD designs exactly.

PSD Files:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/l61tjz46ojrhv6a/AAAkxpCzvW_eAtkm-YhL0-d3a?dl=0

Code: 
All code must be clean and up to best practices. All CSS styling will need to be added to our child theme's style.css file. All code must be compatible with our parent theme and not conflict with any of our plugins. Code must be fully supported on Chrome, Firefox, IE8+, Safari and Windows, Mac OS.

Live Development:
Dev must create page live on our site. Dev can not use different server due to custom font restrictions.

Desktop Screen Resolutions:
The developer must be able to adjust font-sizes and text placement on different screen resolutions. (Code media queries for different breakpoints).

Mobile Screen Resolutions:
Same as above note, the developer must be able to make adjustments on mobile and tablet screen resolutions.

Some content will need to be adjusted for mobile. (For example, our video background will be replaced with a static background image on mobile devices. Since video file isn't supported on all mobile devices).

Also, our header and footer will need to be adjusted to look exactly like our Mobile PSD file. (Our theme does not have a responsive header or footer). So we'll need to adjust the header and footer on mobile to make the page full responsive).";Web Development;PSD to Wordpress - Web Page;http://www.upwork.com/jobs/~015d20f1a5be3be44b;;4;1

CORE FEATURES: 
- Users should be able to perform ""free form"" searches on articles using a search box. The search box should have an autocomplete feature

- Users should be able to access articles based on ""THEMES"", ""AUTHOR"", and similar criteria contained in a database (the database is currently stored in airtable, and a link to access the database can be shared upon request)

- Users should be able to perform the following tasks for each article they access:
  - share articles using one of the following methods: e-mail or social media platforms 
     (specific platform TBD)
 - Print the article

- Users should be able to sign up for the website's newsletter and their contact information should be stored in a table. No other LOGIN or Sign Up feature required. 

- The backend of the website should be accessible to a layperson for day-to-day management of content (uploading of new articles, removal of existing articles, fixing typos etc.)

- The front-end of the website should be simple and attractive. It should optimized for viewing on various devices and built using the latest technologies in Web design.

- The articles are currently mostly in format PDF (with minimal graphics); it would be great if they could all be converted to HTML 5 prior to posting on the website.

I am planning to start a WooCommerce coupon website.

What I need?

I am afiliated to affilate networks. Currently the list is as follows:
1. Rakuten Affiliate Network
2. ShareASale
3. Commission Junction

There are numerous coupons being updated everyday like new ones are added and old ones expire and are of no use after they expire. I need a solution that makes the use of the Affiliate Networks API/Web Services to fetch the list of coupons everyday of all stores and post it to their particular store on my website. 

For Example, Rakuten Affiliate Network provides its webservices to fecth all the Coupons. These are divided as per the stores like Sephora, Vitacost etc. They bifurcate it by themselves and provide coupons for each store. These coupons can be valid for 1 day or 30 days or any date specified by the store. I want Sephora coupons to be fetched and be posted in Sephora coupons list in my website until they are alive. Once they expire, they are to be deleted from here and new coupons to be added. l

The service needs to take the following into note:
1. Store
2. Coupon Validity
3. Images received and posted on my website
4. Data of Users who used the coupon, store, network
5. Export ""Point 4"" to CSV everyday.

In more details:
We have detailed survey data about customers preferences regarding consuming behaviors. 
Out of this data, we need to create and visualize the priors for best messaging for several target groups (clusters).

The project is divided to two steps:

Step 1:
Perform these sub steps: 
a. Analyze data to find best clusters (of customers) to target, in a way that - 
b. for each cluster, find the best set of products and behavioral attributes to target the cluster with to achieve the highest likelihood for engagement. 

The result of Step 1, would be prediction how to target (words / phrases / etc) the decided clusters of customers. 
The result of step 1, should be visualized, potentially in a visualization software such as tableau. 

This result would be the -prior- for step 2. 

Step 2:
Visualize, (potentially using a bayesian simulation) how the prediction precision would get updated as engagement data comes in. 

Example:
Say that in step 1, we had predicted that cluster 1 should be composed of specific demographics, and should be targeted with specific keywords and products. 
In step 2, we would simulate ""fake"" engagement data of the results of cluster 1 customers interactions with the messages, and we should show, how the prior gets updated towards the ""real"" curve. (think ""multi arm bandit"" simulation).

The whole project should be developed as a proof of concept, on real data, and should be pitched and presented to a client, as a pitch towards a bigger on going project.

The customer is currently mainly targeting the Australian Market and is looking to move into new regions to promote their products we are currently running an adwords campaign at the moment to target new areas but also are keen to ensure that we get good organic rankings also.

With link building also I know this can work if done correctly but have heard some bad elements if not done correctly.

Step - 1 : Full Website SEO Health Check
Step - 2 : On Page Optimisation
Step - 3 : Social Media Set Up
Step - 4: Content Marketing & Link Building

Also setting up GLTDs to help target the website to different regions for example

(au.redcatindustries.com)
(nl.redcatindustries.com)

This project is about ""Assessing Current Site Architecture For Future Mobile App"". 

Currently, we have a custom-built software (desktop). We would like to build a mobile app. Ideally, our python backend would power the mobile app through an API endpoint. Looking for a consultant to inspect our code and recommend a course of action needed in order to commence mobile app development. As such, someone with knowledge of backend, site architecture and mobile development would be beneficial.

Initially, I was told our code was kind of a mess and needed to be refactored before any mobile development could be done. We have since done refactoring but I am unsure as to whether our platform's endpoints are useable or if further refactoring / dev ops / architecture need to be done before commencing any mobile app development. 

Thus the scope of this project is to conduct an assessment and give recommendations on what is needed for mobile app. Thereafter, we may enter into discussions about implementing that action plan.

Current Tech stack:
python
mongodb
digital ocean
linux
node js
polymer

When relevant, the assessment should be conducted with Apple and Google PlayStore Guidelines in mind, so that no issues are raised while submitting the App on iTunes and Play Store.

Important Note: Looking to have this assessment and plan completed this week - ideally by Wednesday.

Background:
The webites shows some locations in a city via a slider carousel. Right now all the slides are order due distance frome a central point in the city (market, station etc.). I want to order the slides automaticly depending on the geolocation of the user.

So here is the user storie:
1. user visits website
2. website askes user if geolocation via website is allowed
if user gives permission go to step 3:
if user denies permission got to step 4:

3. the carousel orders the sliders automaticly from the nearest to the furthermost location depending on the current position of the user

4. the user denies permission
5. jump to a form above the slider
6. the user can fill in his position by it´s own (of course it must be ""look and feel"" of a typical google maps search)
7. depending on his position he filled in, the carousel orders the slider from the nearest to the furthermost location

Extras:
- In the navbar is a list, that ist connected to the locations. right now the list is static. So if the order changes through the process (No. 1-7) the list links needs to change too.

Possibly wanting to utilise one of the new Bigcommerce templates, however we need some changes made to it (menu design and a few other tweaks such as adding social media icons and phone number to header etc), as I can't find a template that will be a perfect fit for us.

Alternatively, you may be able to create a custom template from scratch - depending on what you think might work best. I have a wish list and can provide ideas to model from.

Looking for someone who knows the Bigcommerce set up inside out and back to front, with the ability to customise templates to perfection!

I am not particularly technical, so happy to be guided by you regarding implementation. I can install the new template, and use the in built editing functionality for the basics, but need help customising the design and functionality.

I am not completely sure where to go but I am looking for a website very similar to http://www.11plusdiy.co.uk/Products/OnlineTests.aspx .

There also needs to be a free trial of limited questions (from the whole sample) if parents register.

There might also be a free 7 day trial to the whole batch of questions.

I would also like to do something similar to the 11plusDIY website.

However, I want more detailed statistics on the pupils results so they can see how long they took to answer the question compared to the national or regional average, how hard the question was (compared to other peoples result) and how good their test result is with some ranking. Stats need to be also emailed to parents with charts. Also, if students re-take the test then compare their results broken down to each question so they can see which question they consistently get wrong. Then they have the ability to test themselves on similar questions. A good website is http://www.questionmix.com/questions/qid-qm22109/

For this project, we will need someone proficient with Wordpress.  

We have two options and I’ll need to make sure you’re good with either route.

Option 1:

Create a custom Wordpress theme based on this site, only using a different color scheme:  http://www.wefixrimshouston.biz/.  Our client really likes this site.  I like the opaque car on the background that stays in place while you scroll.

Option 2:

Customize one of these themes to remove what we don’t need and tweak what we are keeping.  So the color scheme, the formatting/CSS, the Nav Menu, etc – all would need to be customized for our client.

Some Scope Considerations:
1.	10 page site
a.	Home
b.	Contact
c.	About
d.	Image Gallery (our work / showing before and after)  We will provide you all images.
e.	Rest would be service pages
f.	We will provide the content to you for all pages and you will publish/format to the site
2.	Theme customization to make unique
a.	We will need design mockups of home page and inner HTML page from you
i.	The main theme is going to be patriotic / stars & stripes / red, white and blue colors / All American
ii.	The design will need to have good Call To Actions, be clean and very user friendly.
iii.	2 different design mockups would be required within 3 business days of accepting this job
iv.	There could be up to 3 revisions on the design
v.	We will get clients approval on the design before you move into the coding phase
3.	Will need to include a “Schedule an Appointment” feature
a.	Note:  There are tons of these as plugins on Wordpress.  The difference here is that it will need to integrate with a payment gateway.  So the idea would be to have a page on their website with the ability for a customer to book an appointment for a rep to go by their home, office or whatever the location of the vehicle and repair it on-site.  But upon booking that appointment, the user would be prompted to enter billing details and could pre-pay on the client’s website.

Budget:

We can pay you $800 for this project.  It should be pretty straight forward without any complications.  I would estimate that you can complete the designs within approximately 8 to 10 hours and the development work within 2 to 3 days back to back (but I don’t expect that will be your only project so not expecting you to work continuously on this.)

We will also need you to be available if there are any punchout items needed that we determine necessary as we audit your work, or that is requested by the client – up until they give final approval to launch the site.


Launch:

We will setup the hosting account on our server which you can work from as a dev environment.  Once the site is ready to launch we will unrobot the site from the robots.txt and submit the updated XML sitemap to GSC.


Please let me know if you have any questions when you review this.  I’m looking forward to your response so that we can move forward with you on this today if possible!

I have been trying to get my system operational for a year now!  I have been blatantly ripped off several times and I am on the brink of going crazy.  LONG, LONG, LONG story accompanies this, but I will get straight to what I have and what I want to happen.

Ok, so the system I originally wanted a year ago was an all in one marketing solution for business, WITH an affiliate system so I can have distributors promoting my company.  The tools were to include:

Social Media Management (Auto posting and campaigns to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Tumblr)

Lead Capture Page Generator (obviously with its own unique link for every page created)

Lead Management System

Email Marketing

SMS Text

Affiliate Tracking for each affiliate/distributor

Training Vault (place where I can have training materials to help people be successful in the home business industry.  Needs to be pretty low tech so I can update frequently :) )

So I hired a developer, he put together a WordPress website with a bunch of plugins.  Well, I know nothing of WP, never used it.  The whole system seemed very clunky, hard to use, didn't flow very well, so I never released it or started promoting.  STRIKE 1

I found another developer, explained what I had and he said he could give me what I needed.  I paid him his upfront fee, then poof!  He disappeared never to be heard from again.  STRIKE 2

I then found another developer and we were on the same page and things were going to move forward.  Because I had already spent so much money, I offered the only thing I could at the time, revenue sharing with my company once the system was completed.  Obviously the end result would be way more than a one time payment :)   We moved forward.   I had a vision for my company from a company I used to belong to which was similar.  I had said for a very long time, if only I could bring THAT back.  Well, as circumstance would have it, I was given the software for that company!  Long story short on that, I gave my developer access to that and he could not get the bugs out of it.  The entire thing is in php and he wasn't a php expert.  So, he started building my own system.  After a couple months, he said that he could no longer do this, he just didn't have time.  Which was very unfortunate because he was very cool and he would miss out in the future.  STRIKE 3

So I found another person to work with.  That was 8 months ago!  I gave him access to the php software as well, he couldn't set me up with that so he decided to build my own system.  Well, here it is 8 months later and it's still not up and running like a well oiled machine.  Nothing against this development team, but I need results sooner rather than later.  I also feel like my project was kind of put on the back burner and worked on as ""fill in"" work.  STRIKE 4

My company is a year old and all I have done is waste time and money.  One thing the latest told me though was that I would need to find an SMS provider.  When I started researching this, I found an awesome company that has a very good mobile marketing system already created.  So, I decided to build my own website, www.xtremeleads.net and when/if the other part ever got completed, I could combine the 2 and have exactly what I want.  Well, I discovered that won't work because mine obviously is just a basic landing website, the system is actually with my SMS provider and my landing site can't do any API integration with the provider OR my other system the developer is finishing.   STRIKE 5

So here I am, I have a website, www.xtremeleads.net which I can promote, but I can't do affiliate tracking, lead management, social media management or lead capture pages.  I have an existing WP database that I am now being told CAN look better, function better and have everything tied together.  I have a piece of php software that I KNOW has the capabilities of everything that I want, I just can't find anyone good enough with php to fix it and get it up and running re-branded with my information.  

I need help!

We have an ecommerce website under Woocommerce using the Flatsome theme & around 30 plugins. The website has been created by myself 1 year ago, however with all the plugins installed/uninstalled + all the modifications, it has become a mess. It is hosted on a cloud hosting but we constantly reach its limit and our server is crashing often.


What we need:

We decided to create a new website from scratch, that will be a copy of our current website. We would like our new website to handle up to 500 orders per day, we are selling mainly in the UK but also in other countries such as Australia. The store would have around 30 products that we can add ourselves.

We purchased a dedicated server located in Amsterdam (LiquidWeb) to help handling the traffic and have a better performance (We can upgrade the server if needed). We are also using KeyCDN to get better speed.

The job will consist in re-creating our website on the new server and optimise it to make it ready to handle big traffic & high number of orders every day. You will have to install wordpress, the up to date version of the theme and most of our plugins (We will try to remove some plugins to make the website as light as possible, we will have probably 20 of them left). You will also have to make some design modifications to match our previous website design and maybe improve a bit the current design. Finally, any kind of optimisation to get our website faster will be much welcome.

For the price, I think a hourly rate will be better for both of us but we would like to have an estimate price before we start. I can send you more details of the website by private message if needed.

Future: If the website is handling well our traffic & orders, we would love to work again with you on the maintenance of it and the creation of a couple of new websites under Woocommerce.";Ecommerce Development;Woocommerce new website development - Using Flatsome theme & around 20 plugins;http://www.upwork.com/jobs/~012118a98a04deb4c4;Less than 10 hrs/week;4;1

Your response will include your estimate of time and proposed project cost. The selected candiate will have the project amended to reflect the mutually accepted project cost.

Web application, built on Microsoft Azure using Linux and MySQL (or similar) database
Application must provide a front-end authentication of both a user and agency. This application will eventually be multi-tenant in design.
Upon login, user will be presented with 2 options initially.  New Application and Logout.
New Application should bring up a web-form.  All fields, need to be configurable as mandatory or optional.  One of the fields will be a dollar amount.  This entry needs to be connected to a ""credit limit"" on the user who is logged in.  If the amount if above the user's credit limit, it needs to be flagged for secondary approval once submitted (see below)
Once the application has been filled out and ""submitted"" the application and related data needs to be committed to the database.  Upon submission, an application ID needs to be created/assigned - the Application ID should be a combination of a prefix for the agency and serialized numbers after that.  Example might be 01-00001, 01-00002, 02-00001, 02-00002
Once submitted, if the amount is at or below the authorized credit limit, the submission needs to create 2 PDF documents.  The fields for the PDF will be populated by the entries from the application. One of the documents needs to have a digital signature placed on the document as well.  Eventually, multiple signatures need to be supported based on the agency that is assigned.
Both documents (PDF) need to be emailed to the email address of the user logged in and a copy sent to an administrative email address (customized based on agency)
If the credit limit is above the authorized limit, a notice should be displayed to the user and an email notification sent to the administrative email address
An admin needs to log into the portal (again user and agency dependent) and ""approve"" the pending application
When approved, the application needs to be processed similarly to above
Tracking of secondary approvals should also be contained in the database

Proposed environment is Azure, Linux (distro optional), PHP and MySQL (or similar)

This is the basics of a larger application
Successful candidate will be afforded the option to continue the project on hourly or project basis to build additional features from the roadmap.
Preference to freelancers over agencies (though both will be considered)
Prior experience (or suitable cover letter) combined with cost will be deciding factor
Documentation of work performed in code is essentially and will be independently evaluated by a third party prior to providing feedback upon project completion

Questions, please let me know
Attached is the form you will be responsible for replicating into the web form (Alliance Bail Bonds def_ind info updated 071316.pdf) - all fields should be adjustable as mandatory/optional (this does not have to be an interface option, could be coded initially).  Additionally, you are responsible for the layout of the form being aesthetically smooth.  We will provide feedback on the layout and adjustments to the layout you need to make.  The initial web form should include all the fields from Defendant Information and ending at Promissory Note.  Additional fields should be requested for the Promissory Note and Promissory Note Premium sections.  The Indemnitor Information needs to be obtained as well.  The contents of pages 3 and 4 are not needed for the form.  They will be used when you generate the final products - essentially you are creating a form that will be used to ""form fill"" the PDF.

You must recreate the necessary documents to produce a filled in version of the PDF. With the contents from the form.  The watermark in the document is not needed.

Once the form is submitted, the fields necessary must be merged to produce a finished PDF.  The finished PDF must be formatted as close as possible to the existing PDF without the watermark.

Additionally, you will use the fields from the web form to complete the Tulsa Appearance Bond, which also needs to be recreated, if necessary and formatted as closely as possible to the source documents.  You can inquire to what fields from the web form will be used to fill in various spots on this form.  For any fields not on the web form, we will either add them to the web form or you will provide a blank space, similar to the form for manual filling when printed.

When you reply can you either copy n paste the questions A- G and answer below each question either in BOLD or another colour please to make things easy to follow- THANKS.
If reading this on UPWORK please start your reply 3PARAGREEN please or I will not respond

I have want to sell online, my course of exercises to increase the flexibility of the body.
The content consists of an eBook (6mb) and a series of videos (hosted for now privately on YouTube) 
If reading this on UPWORK please start your reply 3PARAGREEN please or I will not respond


I have a website www.freedomthroughflexibility.com- but needs optimising to act as a landing/sales/opt-in and members area. MAYBE BY CREATING A SUBDOMAIN within my existing site?
I do not have a social media following or an e mail list to bring traffic to my site.


I wish to create sales funnel without using Clickfunnels or Leadpages to sell my course.

I need to know if I need to create a long sales page or short opt - in page (or both - the latter I can easily create myself with Mailchimp). 
(The actual Mailchimp integration I can do myself and the 3-4 e mail follow up too.)

So what I guess what I actually need  (but am open to your knowledgeable advice !) 

A: 
The ability to host a members area on my site where customers who have bought the course can 
1: download the eBook - using a ONETIME code 
2: be redirected to private hosted YouTube or Vimeo videos that only they can see. 

B:  
A delivery system to send customers my eBook to download that is secure and a one time thing

C:
I need to be able to give discounts out for the course that are one time and not reusable or shareable .

D: 
A separate long sales page with benefits and testimonials similar to this example here 
https://www.muscleforlife.com/services/custom-meal-plans/
that is on a separate page or subdomain within/on my website for those who want direct sales
as a OTO 

E:
Your idea on a better more efficient sales funnel without the ongoing expense of Clickfunnels  or Leadpages.

F: 
Your suggestions to drive traffic and sales to my course (Ie Clickbank,Thinkific, Facebook ads)

G: 
Your suggestions for a road map for this sales process- 
Example;
1: An opt in page - follow up Mailchimp campaign of 3-4 free things in follow up e mails- with a Call To Action - One Time Offer- then to Sales Page- Thank You Page and then Download Page in Members Area 
or 
2: 
Long Sales Page with OTO and CTA to a Thank You Page to a Download Page and Members Area (for videos)

Then the timeline and costs to implement either option please

We are looking for a web designer proficient with Wordpress who will take our sketches/ ideas and implement them. We have already purchased the necessary plug-in's, we just need someone to set up the website to our design specifications. Communication and timely completion are key for us!

Project Scope:
1) User account registration set-up (3 levels: 1 Free & 2 Paid user levels, A & B) 
2) Website Data Output (Website will need to populate different data based on signed-in user level vs. random guest)
3) Shopcart functionality (We have digital videos that a paid user will need to have instant access to once they have paid)
4) Short write up so that we can understand how to manipulate/export the member database through Wordpress plugins.

Our website is www.leadme4life.com 
We currently have 3 digital products (videos): VISION, ACTION, & SUCCESS. 
We will have an annual membership in the future (see use case #4).

The deadline for this project to be completed by is 7/24/17. 
Please do not apply for this if you will be unable to finish by the deadline.

This job will be completed when these 6 use cases are proven:
1) A visitor to the website clicks on the ""LEARN MORE"" button on the home page. This will direct them to the specific page they were going to and when the page loads a pop-up will come up and call the user to enter their first name and email to join our mailing list. This email address and first name will be stored in a database. They will be emailed the PDF once a submit button is clicked.
2) A visitor would like to buy 1 video by clicking ""ADD TO CART"" button. Once the button is clicked it will add the ""video"" to their cart. Once they purchase the ""video"" they will need to have direct access to a link to the video in their user account (or some other method to go back to the video).  This would be the Paid A user.
3) A visitor would like to buy all 3 videos. If they buy all 3 videos they will get a $ discount. For example, each video is $15. If you buy all 3, the price will be $30 for all three.
4) Capability to turn on Paid B user functionality at a future time. This will be a separate membership level that will include a physical product. We will discuss this in more detail with you in project scope meeting.
5) All membership levels will need to have a user account page that will display their paid products and allow them to update 5 free fields. These 5 free fields will need to be alpha-numeric and be able to be exported to a database.
6) RESOURCES page content will be hidden for visitors, but shown for FREE membership level and above. If they are a visitor it will prompt them to join by entering their email and first name which will unlock the hidden content.

Essentially, I'm a newbie to website design and I've got probably as far as I can without some guidance.

These are the areas I need help with:

- My main problem is the text on the first strip on the first page gets cut off by the adjacent photo next to it. 
- I've also started adding blog posts, but I'm struggling to format them the way I want - I'd like to have a subtitle to the posts, and also show the date and author (which are shown on the draft, but not on the previewed page.) 
- I have only just begun adding meta data etc for getting on Google, but I probably need some help getting my site found by search engines. I'm not looking for content creation as such, but any help for sorting out the additional information on my pages would be appreciated. For example, am I missing filling in certain fields in Wix, and if so, what kind of information goes in there? 
- Ideally, you can explain what you've done so that I can follow it in the future, though I would like to have someone I can turn to for (paid) help if problems crop up as I add features to the site. If you can be available for voice chat and screen shares through Upwork messenger or Skype, that would be a plus.

 In addition to my website, I may need help designing future pages. I can create them, but I just spend too much time making them look good and do what I want.

The plugin will work like this:
- User inputs YouTube URL into text field
- User clicks generate link
- User taken to view video on site with share buttons
- User gets link to share on Facebook
- Users in Facebook click link from post, takes them to site to watch video

There is a completely DIFFERENT aspect I'm trying to achieve because Facebook displays YouTube videos as small icons (screenshot pic) and this plugin is going to create big nice thumbnails instead.

The link users get to post to Facebook will display a LARGE image that will be clickable to watch as a normal YouTube video would. (screenshot pic2)

The text field will ONLY work if it's a legit link from YouTube

This plugin will also have limited features based on the user being Free or Professional.

I am looking for some adjustment to a BigCommerce theme, Cornerstone Light v1.8.1

Things i am looking to achieve:

1. Make the search always visible on home page & landing pages
2. Make search available within product categories 
3. Make it so when comparing products - it is easy to see the comparison view (right now it is only in the header after you select multiple items - and you have to scroll up to view it - terrible design that needs to be adjusted for my site
4. On the homepage show featured items by categories , that is - instead of just regular featured items - i have 3 main categories of product - i want to show individual rows or a carousel of product categories & featured products within those categories
5. I need to expose a custom field on the items when shown in search results, featured items or when browsing the categories & sub-categories. this could be on-hover or just by the price

Depending on the price - I may choose one or only a few of these customizations.

The developer who was working on the forum had some personal difficulties that had kept him from continue with the project. I have waited for a while, but his situation has not got better. 
This is a joomla website. So I need a developer who is comfortable with joomla content management system. Right now, the login and registration do not work. And I need to change the template. The template right now is ugly. The forum will only have 2 top menus, that’s it. The registration part of the forum is the most important part of the site because, during registration, users will have the opportunity to choose their group or folder from 1 of 2 top or main categories. Each main category will have 2 sub-categories. There will be drop-down options from the sub-categories where users will pick a characteristic that match their condition from one drop-down, then another condition from the other sub-category from each respective main category. Once a user pick a sub-category option 1 and option 2, anything s/he posts will go under that folder. if other users pick the same sub-category options, all their postings will go to that same title of course under their profiles. First top category, 1 drop-down option in the sub-category has 20 options, the other drop-down has 6. If you take 1 option from drop-down 1 and match it with drop-down 2; that is 6 times. So, the first top category will have 120 folders. Second top menu has 20 options on 1 drop-down and 6 options and the other. That is another 120. That may or not may be the most work for the project.
The first top menu is where users will be posting their stories. Anything posted will go under that category (folder) they chose during registration. If someone clicks on a story, there will be a reply button. Users will have 3 options to reply to the person who posted the story.
The 2nd top menu is a picture and video section that attach to that user, meaning the options they choose while registering. 
At last, I need a banner for advertisement- A notification to alert other users when someone posts something. 
In summary, I will need the registration and login to work, a new template, a banner, a notification and a video/picture module.

Looking for a crawler built that will do the following:

Integrate with YouTube’s API and pull information on channels through list. 
The query for the channel selection should be changeable from a config file
The channels should then be queued to find more detailed information on them via database.
The crawler should then store this information in a database that updates based on the channel unique identifier as well as any account information.
Any channels that have already been crawled should update the existing record.
The crawler must respect and pause for the quota limit.
You must use your own API key for testing.
You will likely also need to crawl the guide categories to execute this search.
those can be stored in either the database or in flat files.
Crawl individual channel stats
The information gathered through the individual channel that change over time to produce a time series.
This should either be an entirely separate process, or part of the crawler design.
The following is a bare minimum data and should give you an idea (SEE ATTACHMENT) 


Strong preference to building in JavaScript, but Python or other languages will be considered. 

We require that the database is SQL based. Preference for mysql or postgresql, but using a sqlite3 db will be considered for testing. There is also a strong preference for using a wrapper library such as sequelize.

The following things must be stored in a config file:
parameters for all prioritization queries of api calls
the start point or next page id for each api query. (null for none)
the db urls, and any required config information
API key can either be here or read in from environment.

Step-by-step decisions are listed here: 

Mockup of result of this project: https://i.imgur.com/ibGSgnw.png

1. Download the example file for this “becomeadinosaur” custom Google Maps theme to get started.
https://snazzymaps.com/style/74/becomeadinosaur
2. Delete all elements on the page except the map. Make the map full-screen. Disable the Map/Satellite view button. And disable the street view button too. Set zoom to 12. Set map center to {lat: -28.643387, lng: 153.612224}.
3. The +/- zoom buttons should be on the bottom left. It should look and exact exactly like it does on the snazzy maps website. We will put some html elements under it (see #9 below). 
4. The search box with drop-down suggestions should be on the top right. It should look and exact exactly like it does on the snazzy maps website.
5. Download emojis png files from the links below. They are free. Save them in the images folder.
6. The button on the top left should be an image of an emoji with a hyperlink. Emoji link below. 
7. When the button on the top left is clicked, it should open the default lightbox on the page. Link below. The lightbox should have the “default” behavior as demo’d on the featherlight website. 
8. Resize the emoji png files if you need to for using them as custom markers. Let me know. Place a bunch of those 3 emojis as markers across the map. The exact location doesn’t matter. They should be visible on the map.  
9. The bottom-left and bottom-right should be exactly like this page: http://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/  On the bottom-left, you should have a photo. Use any photo. The text should be “by @developer on Mars”. Do not copy the html, but you can take help from the CSS from here. The markup should be as simple as possible. And you can use in-line css here.  Directly above the photo, place the Google Maps +/- zoom buttons.
10. The bottom right should also look exactly the same as the carbonad on the spinkit page: http://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/. Image with two blocks of text below it. And a slightly transparent background.
11. Move all existing CSS/JS into an external file, and put all of your change there too. Not inline. Keep the lightbox/featherlight code in their separate js/css files.
12. Must be mobile responsive. Please know that I will have to change the text + images in this project. And have to maintain the markup, css and javascript of this website. So please make sure the code is clean and easy to read. Preferably with comments.

Please, do not apply if you don't possess at least on of these qualification. You must be qualified for all. We do not want to wast our time and yours. We will find out immediately if you don't have Big Commerce and on-page SEO experience. 

This is not one entire . I'd like to break it down into milestones in order to execute the most important stages first.  But it will be an ongoing project for some time. I will explain during an interview. We will also discuss cost. 
 
We are looking for someone that, first of all, knows at least 75% of the Big Commerce interface. Must know what you are doing when you are logged in to the back end of our site. Someone that knows what almost every field is for. 

You must possess Adobe Photoshop skills in order to modify product images, create flyers and/or catalogs with our product line. 

You must have SEO experience and know exactly what to do when we ask you to sprinkle SEO throughout the entire site starting with the main category pages. Example: Tags, keywords, keyphrases and some more.

You MUST BE DETAIL ORIENTED. We want a perfectionist. Someone who will get it done the right way on his own without too much of our help or having to explain it to you several times.  We just tell you what we need and you get it done your way because you have the creativity, knowledge and experience to do it.

We are now wanting to invest time on the site in order to give our company a great reputation as well as expand our customer base. But we want the site to do the work for us and not us having to be on the phone with a customer for a long period of time.

We have come to the conclusion that the look and feel of the website's interface (template) is what 's probably not working the way we want it. 


 This is where you step in. 
Your general project would be to make the site attractive and able to convert. By that I mean giving it a web designer's touch of creativity (USER INTERFACE DESIGN) on all aspects. This project will include but is not limited to making the interface applealing and the functionality as simple as possible for our visitors to understand as well as navigate. You will also be checking all of the images for proper tagging, check the site for any on-page SEO opportunities and work on them. Monitor with analytics in order to make proper changes and/or decisions for the site to make progress. 

There will be times where you'll enter product or perhaps fix what another freelancer has done from a previous project. 

Like we mentioned, our site is on Big Commerce and we want to keep it that way. Please DO NOT MAKE ANY OFFERS TO CHANGE TO any other platform as this will automatically disqualify you for the position. PLEASE DO NOT APPLY IF YOU ONLY HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE WITH BIG COMMERCE, OR ONLY HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE WITH SEO.  WE NEED SOMEONE WHO KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE DOING. 

We also want tho keep the logo, perhaps work on the template so that it will make a good partner with the colors of the logo. Perhaps another template or modify the current one.... We don't know and that is why we are here to ask for the assistance of an expert. 

Again, and we are very serious about this, you MUST PAY ATTENTION TO DETAILS because of the product and product categories which you will be working with. 

PLEASE, IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE OF THESE SKILLS,  DO NOT APPLY! WE DON'T WANT TO WASTE BOTH OUR TIMES. We will know immediately if you lack the skills.

If you feel that you are qualified for this project, please visit www.213LED.com and take a look at the entire site. Get a feel of how it looks and works. Once you are ready for us, please send us a message that only says ""213LED A brighter world for you and me"". Do not type anything else do not offer anything else. Simply enter this phrase and send it to us. If you read all the way down to this point and are paying attention and following simple instructions, then you are the type of professional that we're looking for.

I am interested in being tutored in Machine Learning / Data Pre-processing, specifically using Pandas to prepare data for Scikit-Learn modeling.

The data-set I have contains ~300,000 rows representing individual product sales for a company.  The “company” column represents the buyer, the “shipto” column represents the buyers location, the order number is a unique identifier for all things purchased by that company on that date.

There are a number of types of questions I need to ask and answer, including but not limited to:

At a given date, what is the likelihood that a customer will buy a product again?
At a given date, what is the likelihood that a customer will NOT buy a product again?
At a given date, what is the likelihood that a customer will buy a new product, based on previous purchases?
At a given date, what is the likelihood that a customer will dramatically increase or decrease their spend with us in the next 90 days?
At a given date, what is the likelihood that a customer will not buy anything from us over the next 90 days?
What products (or product categories) should I recommend to each client based on their past purchases?

In the past, I have used simple measures like RFM (recency, frequency, and total monetary spend) to answer similar questions, but I know that I can get much better information using Pandas & Scikit learn modeling.  

Here is the type of thing that I want to focus on to start:  I would imagine that things like “days since last purchase per company” by product, or “days since last order per company” by category would be a great metric to have, and I was thinking that filling in all the days between orders for each client would be useful. As well as things like rolling average spend over time period, etc.  But I’m not sure how to fill in those rows & columns in Pandas.

Looking forward to working together,

Please review below and let's start work asap.

1.Follow all design direction I've already made in AI file and make product page 100% same as my Ai file.  -  The reason why I included ai file is to show you opacity, to compare font size and font thickness.

2.Footer also should be 100% same as AI. Footer white box width should be same as product detail white box width. 
  -Buttons, Opacitiy, and etc..should be same as Ai file.
  -Current footer page is for contact us button. 
  -For Shipping & Return, please type random text (using same font) then I will type it later.
  -Footer is only for shop page, product page, cart page, and my page. 

3.Mobile can't be same as desktop but should work properly!
   Please change mobile (shop, product page, cart, and my page) accordingly.

4.Please ask me first if you need to change other parts not included in my direction.

5. Once customers log in, there should be one button generated. so customers can move to "" my page "". - so they can see tracking order, order history and etc.. Do you have any suggestion? There's a page already like that but we don't have button to connect.

6.Please provide me quick short tutorial - how to copy,paste, and change content for shop product for later. So I can upload other items by myself.

It should be done by 1-2 days from the time you accept.

I will provide you AI file, pdf, and font file so you can follow exact same.

It's over half done already so please understand my price..but will give you bonus up to the quality!

Please review below and let's start work asap.

www.keum.us

1.Follow all design direction I've already made in AI file and make product page 100% same as my Ai file.  -  The reason why I included ai file is to show you opacity, to compare font size and font thickness.

2.Footer also should be 100% same as AI. Footer white box width should be same as product detail white box width. 
  -Buttons, Opacitiy, and etc..should be same as Ai file.
  -Current footer page is for contact us button. 
  -For Shipping & Return, please type random text (using same font) then I will type it later.
  -Footer is only for shop page, product page, cart page, and my page. 

3.Mobile can't be same as desktop but should work properly!
   Please change mobile (shop, product page, cart, and my page) accordingly.

4.Please ask me first if you need to change other parts not included in my direction.

5. Once customers log in, there should be one button generated. so customers can move to "" my page "". - so they can see tracking order, order history and etc.. Do you have any suggestion? There's a page already like that but we don't have button to connect.

6.Please provide me quick short tutorial - how to copy,paste, and change content for shop product for later. So I can upload other items by myself.

It should be done by 1-2 days from the time you accept.

I will provide you AI file, pdf, and font file so you can follow exact same.

It's over half done already so please understand my price..but will give you bonus up to the quality!
